"CBS News and “60 Minutes” “replaced” former Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview answers “with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.”",False,"President Donald Trump’s monthslong feud with CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" reignited after the news program released the full, unedited transcript and video of its pre-election interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate.

About three weeks after the Oct. 7, 2024, interview aired, TrumpsuedCBS Broadcasting Inc. and CBS Interactive Inc. for $10 billion, claiming the news outlet deceptively edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to favor Harris. Then, at the end of January, the Federal Communications Commission, led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr,called on CBSto release the unedited transcript and video. CBS News complied,releasing the content publiclyFeb. 5.

In response, TrumppostedFeb. 6 on his social media platform Truth Social that CBS committed ""fraud.""

""CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,"" Trumpwrote. ""They 100% removed Kamala’s horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""

Trump’s statement misrepresents what happened.

Trump is referring to Harris’ answers in two videos CBS News released. In an Oct. 6, 2024,video clippreviewing the interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation,"" Harris answered a question about U.S.-Israel relations. The next day, when the ""60 Minutes"" interview aired, itshowedHarris giving a different answer to the same question.

Thefull, unedited interview transcriptshows that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" took Harris’ answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. It does not show that CBS News replaced Harris’ answers on this topic with a response from a different portion of the interview.

It’s typical for news outlets to edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories.

Trump backed out of his CBS News ""60 Minutes"" interview before the 2024 election, breaking a decadeslong tradition of major party presidential candidates’ interviews with the network ahead of the general election.

PolitiFact contacted the White House for comment, but received no response.



Because the interview aired on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker began the interview with questions about Israel and the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

PolitiFact annotated the unedited interview transcript below to show how ""60 Minutes"" presented Harris’ answers in the preview clip and aired interview.

Here’s a guide, followed by the exchange:

Bold:Only in the preview clip.

Italics:Only in the aired interview.

Bold and italics:In both videos.

Unmarked sections: Not included in either video.

Whitaker:""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid.""

Harris:""Mm-hmm.""

Whitaker:""And yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire, he's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon, he went in anyway.He has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack, and that has the potential of expanding the war.Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

Harris:""Well, let’s start with this. On this subject,the aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis, and the people of Israel.And I think that is the most recent example of why what we do to assist in their defense around military aid is important.And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now,the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages, and create a cease-fire. And we’re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel, and in the region,including with other leaders in the region,including Arab leaders.""

Whitaker:""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.The Wall Street Journal said that he — that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.""

Harris:""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.And we’re not going to stop doing that.We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

Whitaker:""Just one last thing.Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

Harris:""I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’And we are going to do what is important to support whatever leadership is in Israel, that is defending the security of the State of Israel.""

After this response, Whitaker changed topics to ask Harris why she wanted to be president. The Israel topic arose only once more during the interview, when Harris briefly mentioned Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.

The full, unedited interview video isavailable on ""60 Minutes"" YouTube page. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations starts about six minutes in.

You can also read the full, unedited interview transcripthere. The exchange about U.S.-Israel relations is on Pages 11-13. Parts highlighted in yellow were included in the preview clip, parts highlighted in blue were in the aired interview and parts highlighted in green were in both videos.



When publishing the transcripts and video the Federal Communications Commission requested, CBS Newssaid in a statementthat the content shows ""the ‘60 Minutes’ broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.""

In its statement, CBS News noted that it’s common practice for journalists to edit interviews for time, space or clarity. The full, unedited interview video is 57 minutes long; that was edited down to 20 minutes.

CBS News said it broadcast a longer portion of Harris’ answer to Whitaker’s question about U.S.-Israel relations in a preview clip and a shorter version of Harris’ answer was included in the aired interview.

The news outlet said it edited the ""60 Minutes"" interview to include as much of Harris’ answers to Whitaker’s questions as possible, while fairly representing the substance of Harris’ answers.

CBS News made a similarstatementOct. 20, 2024, rebutting Trump’s accusation of deceitful editing.

Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, told PolitiFact that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" edited the Harris interview reasonably. (The Poynter Institute owns PolitiFact.)

""I would say that their edits are completely within the standards that journalists employ when they try to create an informative product for the public,"" McBride said. ""It seems very much like what journalists do with all verbose speakers, including and especially Donald Trump.""

Trump posted on Truth Social that CBS News and 60 Minutes ""replaced"" Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview answers ""with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.""

The full, unedited interview transcript does not show that CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" replaced all of Harris’ answers to questions about U.S.-Israel relations with a response from a different part of the interview. CBS did not change Harris’ meaning.

News outlets commonly edit interviews for length and clarity. CBS News used a longer version of Harris’ response in a video clip previewing the ""60 Minutes"" interview on the CBS News show ""Face the Nation."" It used a shorter excerpt of Harris’ answer in the aired ""60 Minutes"" interview. Both parts of Harris’ answer were taken from the same segment of the interview, the unedited transcript shows.

A media ethics expert said the ""60 Minutes"" interview adhered to typical journalistic standards.

We rate this claim False.

"Says Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, said on April 7, “Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China.”",False,"Editor’s note:On April 9, President Donald Trumpannounced a 90-day delay for some tariffson all countries, except China, a reversal of his previous stance. On April 7, the White House had dismissed rumors of Trump considering a 90-day pause as ""fake news.""

White House officials never publicly mentioned a 90-day pause of President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 7, but X posts falsely saying they did contributed to a briefmulti-trillion dollarstock market rally.

Verified X accounts that cover markets attributed reports of the supposed pause to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had appeared on Fox News that morning. The posts — the first of which was shared at 10:11 a.m. — shared a significantly exaggerated version of Hassett’s response to an interview question about a 90-day pause. That incorrect information was echoed in web headlines and cable outlets that cover the markets.

One larger X account said its post was based on a news headline from an outlet it did not identify. It’s stillunclearwhere that purported headline originated; the markets started climbing at 10:09 a.m., shortly before the first X posts shared the 90-day tariff pause claim.

The rumored tariff reliefboosted the marketafter days of dips since Trump announced across-the-board tariffs on trade partners April 2.

Here’s how the rumor spread before the Trump White House addressed it.

At about 8:30 a.m. E.T., ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian KilmeadeaskedHassett whether the administration would consider a 90-day pause on tariffs.

""Yeah, you know, I think the president is going to decide what the president’s going to decide,"" Hassett said. ""There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president. We’ve got the prime minister of Israel coming today. We’ve had a reach out overnight from Taiwan. But I would urge everyone — especially (Bill Ackman) — to ease off the rhetoric a little bit."" (Ackman, a billionaire who endorsed Trump,saidthe president’s policies might trigger a ""self-induced economic nuclear winter."")

The distortion of Hassett’s remarks appeared to start with the X account Hammer Capital at 10:11 a.m.

""Hassett: Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China,"" the accountpostedin all capital letters. Then, in lowercase text: ""Mother of all squeezes incoming.""

Hammer Capital had nearly 700 followers April 7, and the account’s blue check mark shows that its owner is an X Premium subscriber.

Twominuteslater, the ""Walter Bloomberg"" X account shared a red siren emoji andthe samepurported Hassett statement in all capital letters. The anonymous account, with 850,000 followers, primarily postsBloomberg Terminalheadlinesabout the markets. Although it isn’t affiliated with Bloomberg News, TechCrunchreportedit has been considered a reliable source of business news.

A 10:14 a.m.articleon ForexLive, a market news and analysis website, warned that the viral headline’s source was unclear even though the headline was being shared ""everywhere.""

Around the same time, CNBC anchors attempted to explain a sudden market rally.

""Apparently, Hassett’s been saying that Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China,""saidCNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla.

Jeremy Siegel, a frequent CNBC guest and Wharton School professor emeritus of finance, said: ""Oh, well that’s huge. I mean that changes the game.""

""We’ll try and source that exactly in terms of where that’s coming from,"" CNBC host David Faber said. A few moments later, a CNBC chyron repeated the claim circulating on X. After those initial mentions, CNBC reporters discussing the reported headline repeatedly said that the White House had not confirmed the news.

A CNBC spokesperson said later that as the network reported the market news in real-time, it had aired unconfirmed information in a graphic. Within about 20 minutes of its original report, CNBC’s senior Washington correspondent Eamon Javers made an on-air correction.

Next, Reuters ran a story crediting CNBC. The newswire later withdrew the story, according to anarchived version of the link.

""Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China,"" the storysaid. ""The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.""

At 10:33 a.m., CNBC’s Javersreportedthat White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told him the 90-day pause chatter was ""fake news.""

By 10:38 a.m., the White House’s Rapid Response 47 X account alsodismissedclaimsof an upcoming 90-day tariff pause.



Wrong. Not only did Director Hassett not say this (clip below),@POTUShas been clear — ""it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!""https://t.co/3Kvt8AScAZpic.twitter.com/JHucHjZm3S

Searching Google and the Nexis news database, we found no credible reports the Trump administration publicly considered a 90-day tariff pause.

In response to journalists’ questions on X, the account Hammer Capital did not provide the source of the information in its initial X post. At almost 1 p.m., the accountsaidit had been ""regurgitating what the market was reacting to"" after ""trading desks started sending out this headline at 10:09."" PolitiFact messaged Hammer Capital on X and received no response.

The Walter Bloomberg account owner also did not respond to our email inquiry asking for the source of its post. The account owner toldThe Wall Street Journalthey first saw the headline at 10:09 a.m. Those who run the Walter Bloomberg account founda 10:12 a.m. X postfrom another stock market-focused account and, ""given the market movement,"" determined the headline must be credible and shared it, The Wall Street Journalreported.

For the media, the incident revealed reporting difficulties when facing ""a highly volatile stock market,"" said Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota professor of media ethics and law. She said the ""missing piece"" for news organizations was getting a response from the White House before publishing the original stories.

""The White House may not have been immediately forthcoming, but ultimately, news organizations should do everything possible to confirm a rumor — especially one with the implications this one had,"" she said.

X posts say Hassett said, ""Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China.""

The posts appear to have been amplifying a distortion of a noncommittal response Hassett gave on ""Fox & Friends"" to a question about the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. We found no credible reports that the Trump administration was ever considering a 90-day tariff pause.

The White House responded to a post echoing this claim on X, writing, ""Wrong. Fake News.""

We rate this claim False.

"“Daughter of boxing legend, Muhammed Ali, Laila Ali, has lost her life while giving birth in a Canadian hospital.”",False,"Laila Ali, a retired professional boxer and daughter of the late boxing legend Muhammad Ali, is alive.

But a death hoax about her purported passing spread widely enough online that she felt compelled to correct the record.

""I’m fine, I’m healthy,"" she said in a March 30 videopostedon her verified Facebook page. She then referred to the rumor that’s drawing attention in other Facebook posts.

""Another tragedy has struck the boxing world, as daughter of boxing legend, Muhammed Ali, Laila Ali, has lost her life while giving birth in a Canadian hospital,"" one suchpostsaid. ""This is coming hours after boxing great George Foreman lost his life at 76.""

"In November 2025, actor Alyssa Milano wrote an open letter addressed to U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticizing the congresswoman's longstanding support for President Donald Trump, that started: ""Congresswoman Greene, Let’s skip the pleasantries. They were never your thing anyway.""",True,"In late November 2025,socialmediausersclaimed(archivedhere,here,hereandhere) that actor and activist Alyssa Milano wrote an open letter to U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticizing the congresswoman's longstanding support for President Donald Trump despite Greene breaking from his administration onseveral issuesin the second half of 2025.
On Nov. 21, Greeneannounced(archived) she wouldresignfrom Congress effective Jan. 5, 2026. Her decisionfollowedapublicfalling-outwithTrump(archived,archived)over his stance on releasing files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and broader disagreements over foreign affairs and health care policy.
According to the social media posts, Milano's purported letter, dated Nov. 17, began:
Congresswoman Greene, Let's skip the pleasantries. They were never your thing anyway.
So…you've suddenly discovered that Donald Trump, the man you treated like a messiah, is not loyal and that the MAGA movement is not safe, not sane, and certainly not rooted in anything constitutional. And you're shocked that he's attacking you, endangering you, calling you a traitor. As if you didn't know he had it in him. Puh-lease.
Here's the part you don't get to skip:
You helped create this monster. You fed it. You protected it. You celebrated it. And now that it's finally turning on you, you want sympathy? Understanding? A moment of national concern?
No. Absolutely not. NOPE.
Becauselettersandstatementsare sometimes misattributed to public figures, multiple Snopes readers emailed us and searched our website to verify whether the letter was accurately attributed to Milano.
In this instance, the actor did write the letter. Milano posted links to it on her verifiedFacebook(archived) andInstagram(archived) accounts. She published the full letter in aNov. 17 poston her verified Substack (archived) with text that matched what people shared on social media.
In her letter, Milano criticized Greene for what shedescribedas empowering Trump's Make America Great Again movement and then objecting when she became a target. She alsoarguedthat Greene's call to release the Epstein files was driven by ""fear"" rather than ""courage.""
Milanoconcludedthe letter by calling for Greene's ""public, unequivocal accountability"" if she wants ""redemption,"" writing that ""real accountability means going fully public with everything you know, every lie, every scheme, every threat, every abuse of power you witnessed, tolerated, or assisted.""
The full text of Milano's open letter was as follows (emphasis hers):
Congresswoman Greene,
Let's skip the pleasantries. They were never your thing anyway.
So…you've suddenly discovered that Donald Trump, the man you treated like a messiah, is not loyal and that the MAGA movement is not safe, not sane, and certainly not rooted in anything constitutional. And you're shocked that he's attacking you, endangering you, calling you a traitor. As if you didn't know he had it in him. Puh-lease.
Here's the part you don't get to skip:
You helped create this monster. You fed it. You protected it. You celebrated it. And now that it's finally turning on you, you want sympathy? Understanding? A moment of national concern?
No. Absolutely not. NOPE.
You don't get to unleash political poison into the bloodstream of American politics and then act surprised when it reaches your own veins. You don't get to cheer on Trump while he smears, threatens, and dehumanizes everyone in his way, and then clutch your fake pearls when he finally does it to you. You don't get to empower a movement built on conspiracy, cruelty, and violence, and then cry foul when you become its latest target.
Let's be honest, you calling for the release of the Epstein Files, isn't courage. It's fear. You don't suddenly care about truth or justice. And you definitely don't care about the victims. You are calling for the release of the files because you're afraid of what unchecked power looks like when it's no longer aimed at your enemies. The Epstein case is a perfect cultural lightning-rod and your supporters love that shit. You saw the polls and are reacting accordingly. Jump off the sinking MAGA ship, am I right, MTG?
Now you're talking about accountability and transparency. Ha! Where was that energy on January 6th? Where was your outrage when Trump incited a mob to storm the Capitol? When they hunted Democratic lawmakers through hallways? When they called for the hanging of the Vice President? When police officers were beaten, crushed, and traumatized doing their jobs?
Where was your moral clarity then, MTG?
Where was your voice when Democratic governors were receiving kidnapping threats? When election workers were doxxed and terrorized? When a man broke into Nancy Pelosi's home with a hammer and nearly killed her husband? When threats against Democrats, judges, school boards, and public servants skyrocketed?
You said nothing.
And this isn't new behavior. You chased a Parkland school-shooting survivor, David Hogg, down a Washington sidewalk, taunting him and calling him a ""coward."" You screamed through President Biden's State of the Union address like you were the most unprofessional person to ever be elected into office.You voted against the Frederick Douglass Human Trafficking Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, (one of only twenty members of Congress to oppose a bipartisan bill designed to help trafficking victims).
You amplified QAnon conspiracies. You suggested school shootings were staged. And while Democrats were being targeted, when a militia plotted to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and when Governor Josh Shapiro's home was set on fire in an arson attack with his family inside, you offered no outrage, no sympathy, no defense of democracy.
I could go on. But I think you get the picture, Congresswomen. I'm not buying it.
If you want redemption. If you want to step into the light, there is only one door:
Public, unequivocal accountability. Not the performative kind with hair and make-up. Not the ""Trump hurt my feelings"" kind. Not the victimhood you've perfected. Real accountability means going fully public with everything you know, every lie, every scheme, every threat, every abuse of power you witnessed, tolerated, or assisted. If you want redemption, start with the truth. All of it.
Until then, this isn't a moral awakening. It's simply the consequences of your own choices arriving right on schedule.
Sincerely,
Alyssa Milano

"In mid-December 2025, the official White House X account posted an image depicting U.S. President Donald Trump as a Minecraft character.",True,"The image did not appear to be a real screenshot from the game and instead may have been AI-generated.
In December 2025, social media users shared what appeared to be a screenshot of the official White House X account posting an image of U.S. President Donald Trump as a character from the popular game Minecraft. In the screenshot, the White House wrote, ""AMERICA'S MOST PRO-GAMER PRESIDENT"" followed by a trophy emoji and the image.
The claim was spread onReddit(archived),X(archived),Threads(archived) andFacebook(archived). Snopes readers searched the site to find out whether the claim was true.
The screenshot was of a real social media post from the White House. It posted the image of Trump as a Minecraft character to multiple social media sites, includingX(archived) andInstagram(archived). Therefore we've rated this claim true.
The White House posted the image in response to anarticle from Moss Adams, an accountant advisory firm, explaining how video game developers could take advantage ofresearch and development tax credits(which have existed foryears).
This isn't the first time the White House has posted an image of Trump as a character from a video game. In October, it posted animage(archived) of Trump with the armor of the Halo franchise's Master Chief. Some people on social mediadoubted the authenticity of that post(archived), as well.
But while the post was real, the image within it did not appear to be a real screenshot from the game Minecraft. People who play Minecraft cancustomize their character modelsby uploading a flat image file. This makes it impossible for someone to layer the clothing on their character model, like the bottom portions of the tie and the suit jacket are on the Trump's character.
Trump's character model also had several other giveaways that it was not an in-game screenshot and was likely even generated by artificial intelligence  tools. The model bends at the elbows and knees, something real Minecraft models don't do. The American flag pin, which was visible on the version from X but not the version the White House posted to Instagram, was too small and detailed to be on a real Minecraft model.
While AI detection tools are prone to mistakes and cannot be used alone to determine if an image was created with AI tools, two tools,HiveandSightengine, rated the likelihood the image was AI-generated to be 100% and 99%, respectively.
Snopes has previously fact-checked other claims about posts apparently made by Trump or the White House, such asthis fabricated postof Trump saying ""the king decides"" what's a war crime."

The claim also circulated onFacebook(archived),Instagram(archived),Threads(archived),Reddit(archived)andBluesky(archived). Snopes readers wrote in, asking if the claim was true.
Petition EN7254(archived), also titled ""Ban Trump from Australia,"" was a real online petition to the Australian House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The petition asked the House to ""permanently ban Trump, his family, and his administration from Australia."" The 2723-signature petition was closed at the time of this writing and awaiting a response, according to the Australian Parliament's petition website.
Petitions with more than 50 signatures generally receive aresponsefrom a relevant minister, according to the Australian Parliament's website. Petition EN7254 had not yet received a response, though it had been 189 days since the petition closed at the time of this writing, indicating that it was still under review. Given the above, we rate this claim true.
We reached out to the Australian Parliament to understand the status of the petition and await a reply.
Petition EN7254 read:
Australians have VALUES of mateship, hard work, righting wrongs, and fighting for the underdog. We don't need Trump here, a Putin aligned dictator who is spreading misinformation, hate speech and stands for the opposite of what we do. His actions are hurting and endangering OUR COUNTRY and we should ban him from coming here as an agent of hate and a danger to world peace.
The Australian government can ban people from traveling to the country. Recently, the government sanctioned Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Those sanctions included a travel ban,accordingto the Australian ABC.
It was unclear at the time of this writing whether Petition EN7254 would result in legal action. The petition appeared to breach the Australian parliament'srules on ""Good language,""which dictate that petitions could not ""include a person's name."" Petition EN7254 included both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's names.
Though Petition EN7254 was closed at the time of this writing, a different one,Petition EN8418(titled ""Invite President Donald Trump to Australia"") remained open for signatures. That petition used similar language to EN7254, referenced similar national values of ""mateship, hard work, righting wrongs, and fighting for the underdog"" and named Trump and Putin but argued that the governmentshouldinvite the U.S. President for a visit.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture told grocery stores they are prohibited from offering special discounts to customers affected by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding lapse during the government shutdown that began in October 2025.,True,"Grocery stores can apply for a waiver to provide special discounts to SNAP customers.
In late 2025, a rumor spread online that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) sent a notice to retailers telling them they can't offer special discounts to food stamp recipients whose benefits had beenreducedamid the government shutdown that began in October.
The claim spread onX,RedditandInstagram. Posts circulating on social media often included ascreenshotof the alleged ""retailer notice"" the USDA sent, which stated, ""OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR SERVICES ONLY TO SNAP PAYING CUSTOMERS IS A SNAP VIOLATION UNLESS YOU HAVE A SNAP EQUAL TREATMENT WAIVER."" The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is the formal name for the food stamp program and it provides food assistance to millions of low-income people.
The retailer notice in the screenshot above was real and can be found on the USDAwebsite(archived). As such, we have rated this claim true.
The federalrulesfor SNAP prevent recipients of food assistance from receiving different treatment from other store customers. As USDA's notice stated, retailers can apply for awaiverto get around these rules, though.
USDA sent Snopes a link to the notice in an email. The agency did not answer additional questions.
As SNAP funding ran out over Halloween weekend,twofederaljudgesruledthat freezing payments for the food assistance program was unlawful. As of this writing, the Trump administrationplannedto restart SNAP benefits using a USDA contingency fund, but would only pay out half of what people normally get. Officials havewarnedof delays. On average, SNAPprovides$188 per month, or about $6 per day, in benefits to help seniors, people with disabilities and families purchase household food staples.
According to USDA's website, as of this writing, thenoticewas last updated on Oct. 31. Here's what it says in full, with the third bullet point specifying rules around retailer discounts for SNAP recipients (emphasis theirs):
Multi-Store Owners (MSO): Reach out to your FNS point-of-contactAll other store owners: Call the SNAP Retailer Service Center at 1-877-823-4369
Please direct questions toRPMDHQ-Web@fns.usda.gov
The SNAP Equal Treatment Rule referenced in the notice above is apreexisting rulerequiring that retailers offer SNAP recipients the same kind of purchasing power as everyone else, such as equal access to discounts and promotions. It largely appears to focus on the possibility of SNAP recipients being discriminated against and being charged more, rather than the other way around (emphasis ours):
(b)Equal treatment for coupon customers.Coupons shall be accepted for eligible foods at the same prices and on the same terms and conditions applicable to cash purchases of the same foods at the same store except that tax shall not be charged on eligible foods purchased with coupons. However, nothing in this part may be construed as authorizing FNS to specify the prices at which retail food stores may sell food. However, public or private nonprofit homeless meal providers may only requestvoluntaryuse of SNAP benefits from homeless SNAP recipients and may not request such household using SNAP benefits to pay more than the average cost of the foodpurchasedby the public or private nonprofit homeless meal provider contained in a meal served to the patrons of the meal service. For purposes of this section, ""average cost"" is determined by averaging food costs over a period of up to one calendar month. Voluntary payments by SNAP recipients in excess of such costs may be accepted by the meal providers. The value of donated foods from any source shall not be considered in determining the amount to be requested from SNAP recipients. All indirect costs, such as those incurred in the acquisition, storage, or preparation of the foods used in meals shall also be excluded. In addition,if others have the option of eating free or making a monetary donation, SNAP recipients must be provided the same option of eating free or making a donation in money or SNAP benefits.

"During President Joe Biden’s four years in office, “31% of U.S. job growth” came from public-sector jobs.",False,"The conservative X account End Wokeness said former President Joe Biden presided over an economy that was heavily driven by government growth, rather than job gains in the private sector.

AMarch 7postto its 3.6 million followers said:

2017-2020:

Public sector: 9% of U.S. job growth

Private sector: 91% of U.S. job growth

2021-2024:

Public sector: 31% of U.S. job growth

Private sector: 69% of U.S. job growth

The 2017 to 2020 numbers coincide with President Donald Trump’s first term and are roughly accurate. But the post significantly exaggerated the government jobs gained under Biden.

We sent a direct message to the End Wokeness account for this article but did not hear back.

Private sector employment can be calculated by subtractinggovernment employmentfromoverall employment, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

For Trump’s first term, we calculated the change in employment from January 2017 through February 2020, right before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a substantial impact on employment. Overall, employment rose by almost 6.7 million jobs during that period; 92% were private sector jobs, while 8% were in government. That’s close to what the X post said.

The post’s figures for February 2025 accurately represent the data for one month of Trump’s second term

For Biden, though, the post’s numbers are off base.

We first calculated job growth during Biden’s entire tenure, from January 2021 through December 2024. During that period, jobs grew by 16 million, with 11% of those gains — not 31% — from government jobs, while 89% were from private-sector jobs.

Biden-era government job gains did make up a larger portion of overall job growth beginning in    June 2022, when employment returned to its prepandemic peak. Of about 6.6 million jobs created between then and the end of Biden’s term, 22% were in government compared with 78% from the private sector.

There’s a reason for the faster government job growth after that point, said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. By June 2022, there was a labor shortage, and private employers were able to raise wages faster than governments, because the latter requires legislative action. That enabled private companies to capture more workers quickly. Governments caught up by later in Biden’s term.

An End Wokeness post said that during Biden’s four years in office, ""31% of U.S. job growth"" came from public-sector jobs.

During Biden’s time in office, 11% of job gains were in the public sector.

This represented a slight increase over the growth in public sector jobs during Trump's first term, but was only one-third as high as the post said.

Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation that would put conservative activist Charlie Kirk's likeness on U.S. currency.,True,"The legislation has not passed as of this writing, but if Congress passed it into law, the limited-edition commemorative silver dollar coins would be issued only in the 2026 calendar year.
Following thefatal shootingof conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September 2025, a rumor spread online that Republican lawmakers had introduced a bill that would put the Turning Point USA co-founder's face on U.S. currency.
For example, on Sept. 27, oneInstagrampage claimed: ""According to reports, two House Republicans plan to introduce a bill to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins honoring Charlie Kirk following his assassination earlier this month.""
Theclaimalso spreadon X,YouTubeandFacebook. Meanwhile, Snopes readers searched the website for ""Charlie Kirk currency.""
In short, the proposedbillwas real. On Sept. 26, Republican U.S. Rep. Abraham J. Hamadeh of Arizona formallyintroducedlegislation""to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of Charlie Kirk."" At the time of introduction, the legislationhadat least 16 additional lawmakers — all Republican — signed on as co-sponsors. Thus, we have rated this claim as true.
However, the legislationhadnot passed as of this writing. Hamadeh's office did not immediately return an inquiry asking about the likelihood of the bill becoming law.
The official website for Congressional legislationhad not publishedthe bill's full text as of Sept. 30 (archived). However, Hamadeh provided acopyin a Sept. 26news releaseabout the commemorative Kirk coin proposal. The bill described Kirk's work with Turning Point USA and his ""tragic death on September 10, 2025"" (see Page 2).
Based on the draft, the commemorative silver coins would be worth a dollar each (see Page 4, Line 1), no more than 400,000 would be created and they would be issued only ""during the 2026 calendar year"" (see Page 5, Line 16), thus making them limited edition.
From Line 13 onward on Page 4, the bill said the front of the coins would ""bear the image"" of Kirk, while the back would include the words: ""Well done, good and faithful servant."" The following words and phrases also would be inscribed: ""Charlie James Kirk,"" ""Liberty,"" ""In God We Trust,"" ""United States of America"" and ""E Pluribus Unum.""
Elsewhere on Page 4, the proposed bill added that the coins ""shall be legal tender,"" meaning that they could be used as real currency.
However, the Treasury Department's websitenotedthat commemorative coins in general ""are not minted for general circulation."" Instead, they areproducedto ""celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and institutions."" They also help raise money for various causes through asurchargeon the coins that ""goes to organizations and projects that benefit the community.""
Hamadeh's legislation did not include a surcharge on the Kirk coin.
Past silver dollar commemorative coins have beared the likeness of notable people such as American abolitionistHarriet Tubman, teacher and NASA astronautChrista McAuliffeand French educatorLouis Braille, who invented the braille system of reading and writing for people with visual impairments.
According to Hamadeh'snews release, if Congress enacted the legislation into law, Kirk would be the ""youngest individual to ever be immortalized on U.S. currency.""

"Turning Point USA CEO and co-founder Charlie Kirk said George Floyd was a ""scumbag.""",True,"Kirk made the statement in reference to Floyd's alleged criminal history and the circumstances surrounding his death. Kirk's exact words were: ""I am also going to offer some context and some nuance about the death of George Floyd that no one dares to say out loud. Which is that this guy was a scumbag. Now, does that mean he deserves to die? That's two totally different things — of course not.""
In the days following Charlie Kirk's assassination in September 2025, social media was flooded withallegedquotesfrom the conservative activist — including a wildly shared claim that he once called George Floyd a ""scumbag.""
Snopes readers emailed and searched our website about the purported quote involving Floyd, the Black man who died while in a chokehold by a white police officer in May 2020, prompting protests against racism in policing worldwide.
""George Floyd was a father too and Charlie Kirk called him a 'scumbag,'"" read one Xpost(archived) with over 19 million views.
The claimspreadonX,FacebookandInstagram, as well as via outlets such asBlack News,Arkansas TimesandIndia Times.
It was true Kirk called Floyd a ""scumbag"" during a 2021 public appearance in Mankato, Minnesota, according to avideoof that event. He apparently made the comment in reference to Floyd'salleged criminal historyand the circumstances surrounding his death.
Kirk's exact words were: ""I am also going to offer some context and some nuance about the death of George Floyd that no one dares to say out loud. Which is that this guy was a scumbag. Now, does that mean he deserves to die? That's two totally different things — of course not.""
The event took place on Oct. 6, 2021, at Minnesota State University as part of Kirk's ""Exposing Critical Racism Tour."" Turning Point USA, Kirk's political organization,streamed(archived) the event live on YouTube under the title, ""LIVE: Charlie Kirk at Minnesota State University - Mankato."" (Kirk made the ""scumbag"" remark around the 15:28 mark in the video.)
Below is our transcript of the relevant portion of Kirk's speech, with emphasis added for clarity:
On May 25th, 2020, up in Minneapolis, a cell phone video changed the trajectory of our entire nation. In this state.
The reason why our tour is called the CRT [Critical Racism Tour] Tour is because of George Floyd's death and the misinterpretation of that. And I'm not going to go on this endless soapbox defending Derek Chauvin, I think he's kind of not a great person. ButI am also going to offer some context and some nuance about the death of George Floyd that no one dares to say out loud. Which is that this guy was a scumbag. Now, does that mean he deserves to die? That's two totally different things — of course not.
After that comment, Kirk listed a series of accusations about Floyd's background,criminal historyand cause of death — all with varying degrees of legitimacy. The Associated Press, reporting on the event,describedthat section of the speech as ""an avalanche of aspersions and debunked claims about Floyd.""
Kirk claimed protests and debates following Floyd's death were based on a ""misinterpretation"" of the event.
At the time, several media outlets reported on the event and Kirk's comments about Floyd, including theMinnesota Reporterand University of Alabama student-run publicationThe Crimson White.
The ""scumbag"" statement is just one of many purported quotes by Kirk circulating after his death. For example, social media users were sharing anauthentic quotehe made about some prominent Black women not having""the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,"" as well as afalse rumorabout him supposedly saying gay people should be stoned to death."
"Rock musician Jack White responded to the White House's criticism of him with a statement calling the administration ""petty and pathetic and thin skinned.""",True,"In November 2025, a pair of popularFacebook(archived)posts(archived) claimed rock musician Jack White, whose former band The White Stripes is known for the song ""Seven Nation Army,"" had an ""exceptional response"" to the White House attacking him.
According to the posts, the White House called White a ""washed-up, has-been loser"" with a ""stalled career"" who has been ""masquerading as a real artist."" White's response apparently highlighted that despite his frequent criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, it wasn't until he remarked on the decor of the Oval Office that the White House replied with insults. The posts claimed White went on to call the Trump administration ""petty and pathetic and thin skinned"" and said the comment about White masquerading as a real artist would be his tombstone engraving.
Similar claims appeared on varioussocial media(archived)platforms(archived) three months earlier.
The claim was true, and the direct quotes attributed to both White and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung were accurate. The back and forth between them took place in August 2025, a few months prior to the Facebook posts about the exchange.
The exchange began Aug. 18, 2025, when White posted aphoto(archived) to Instagram of Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking to each other in the Oval Office, which Trump had by then filled with gold decor. ""Look at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House,"" White wrote in the post. ""It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.""
In the subsequent days,The Daily BeastandThe Hillreached out to the White House for comment. Cheung gave both the following statement:
Jack White is a washed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career. It's apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of ""The People's House.""
On Aug. 20, White responded to Cheung's statement through apost on Instagram(archived). The Instagram post began with an image of Trump holding up a pair of golden sneakers, followed by two images of White's written response. The rest of the images in the post were either of or related to Trump.
A post shared by Jack White (@officialjackwhite)
The written section began by quoting Cheung's statement. After that came White's response, which we've reproduced in full below:
Listen, I'm an artist and not a politician so I'm in no need to give my answer or opinion on anything if I'm not inspired or compelled, but how funny that it wasn't me calling out trump's blatant fascist manipulation of government, his gestapo ICE tactics, his racist remarks about Latinos, Native Americans, etc. his ridiculous ""wall"" construction, his attacks on the disabled, his attempted coup and mob insurrection and destruction of the sacred halls of congress, his disparaging sexist and pedophilic remarks about women, his obvious attempts at distraction about being a close personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein and his inclusion in the Epstein files, his ignorance of the dying children in Sudan, Gaza, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his lack of empathy for military veterans and those struggling with poverty, his attempts to dismantle healthcare, his obvious wimpy and pathetic kowtowing to the dictators Putin and Kim Jong Un, his nazi like rallies, his attempts to sell merchandise and products like Goya beans through the office of the President, his fake ""gunshot to the ear"" that he showed no medical records or photographs of, his constant, constant lying to the American people, etc. etc. etc. No, it wasn't me calling out any of that, it was the f*****g DECOR OF THE OVAL OFFICE remarks I made that got them to respond with insults. How petty and pathetic and think skinned could this administration get? ""Masquerading as a real artist""? Thank you for giving me my tombstone engraving! Well here's my opinion, trump is masquerading as a human being.
He's masquerading as a christian, as a leader, as a person with actual empathy. He's been masquerading as a businessman for decades as nothing he's involved in has prospered except by using other people's money to find loophole after loophole and grift after grift. His staff of professional liar toadies like Steven Cheung and Karoline Leavitt have been covering up and masking his fascism as patriotism and fomenting hatred and division in this country on a daily basis. And I have ""ample time on (my) hands""? That orange grifter has spent more tax payer money cheating at golf than helping ANYONE in the country. Improve. Anything. There is no progress with him, only smoke and mirrors and tax breaks for the ultra wealthy. So maga folk, enjoy your concrete paving over of the rose garden, your 200 million dollar ballroom in the White House, and your gaudy a** gold spray painted trinkets from Home Depot, cause he ain't spending any money on helping YOU unless you fit into his white supremacist country club rich idiot agenda. Wow, he hates who you hate....good for you, be proud of yourselves, how christian of you all.
The only way you can support this conman is because you are a victim of the 2 party system and you ""defend your guy no matter what he does"". No intelligent person can defend this low life fascist. This bankrupter of casinos. This failed seller of trump steaks, trump vodka, trump water, etc. This man and his goon squad have failed upwards for decades and have fleeced the American people over and over. This professional golf cheat, this grifter who has hundreds of thousands of deaths from his inaction of the pandemic on his hands, this man that the majority of the country somehow were fooled into supporting and voting into office (through the flawed electoral college) and their love of reality television stars. Being insulted by the actual White House that this particular conman leads is a badge of honor to me, because anyone who trump supports and likes is a villain who gives nothing to their fellow man, only takes what can benefit themselves. And no I'm not a Democrat either, I'm a human being raised in Detroit, I'm an artist who's owned his own businesses like his own upholstery shop and recording label since he was 21 years old who has enough street sense to know when a 3 card monte dealer is a cheap grifter and a thief.
The Facebook posts matched White's response as well as Cheung's."

President Donald Trump’s “official schedule was suddenly suspended.”,False,"Labor Day weekend might have been quiet at the White House, but one viral video worked overtime to add fuel to unsubstantiated social media rumors about President Donald Trump’s health.

""In the past few hours speculation has spread suggesting that something extremely serious may have happened to President Donald Trump,"" a narrator with a news-reporter cadence announced in a video posted to X onSept. 1. ""It all began when the president’s official schedule was suddenly suspended without any convincing explanation, sparking doubts about his true state of health."" The video had been viewed more than 1.4 million times as of late afternoon Sept. 2

The video said after Trump was diagnosed with a vascular condition, ""All official commitments have been canceled and the White House website has stopped displaying future events.""

The White Housein July announcedthat Trump has a common vein condition known as chronic venous insufficiency. It’s not typically life-threatening.

And although Trump’s Labor Day weekend was low-key — he golfed and met with his grandchildren — hisofficial schedulewasn’t suspended. To the contrary, it detailed his meetings and golfing outings.

His schedule for Aug. 25 to Sept. 2 continued to be publicly released and chronicled numerous meetings, appearances and actions.

Monday, Aug. 25:

The presidentsignedthree executive orders: onWashington, D.C.crime; onprosecutingpeople for burning the American flag; and onendingcashless bail. He alsometwith South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

Tuesday, Aug. 26:

Trump led a three-hour, televisedCabinet meeting.

Wednesday, Aug. 27:

Trump had lunch with Vice President JD Vance andsigneda proclamation honoring Minneapolis’ Annunciation Catholic School shooting victims.

Thursday, Aug. 28:

Trump received an intelligence briefing and signedtwoexecutiveorders.

Friday, Aug. 29:

Trump had no public events scheduled but sat for aninterviewwith Reagan Reese of the Daily Caller.

Tuesday, Sept. 2:

Trumpspokeat the White House announcing his administration’s plan to move U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama. He also said the U.S. had carried out a strike to a Venezuelan ""drug-carrying boat"" in the southern Caribbean. Trump answered multiple media questions.

When a reporterasked himif he knew about the social media rumor that he had died, Trump said, ""I was very active during the weekend,"" and that he did a Daily Caller interview, visited people at his golf club and posted on Truth Social ""numerous"" times. Trump’s Truth Social account published 128postsin seven days ending Sept. 2. An Aug. 31postread, ""Never felt better in my life.""

The video shared on X also said the White House website had stopped displaying future events, but there was no change in the White House’s usual scheduling procedures. The White House typically sends daily guidance to the media one day in advance. On Sept. 1, the schedule included his planned Sept. 2 White House announcement.

The X video was originallypostedAug. 30 by a TikTokaccount. Among the account’s other posts are videos that used artificial intelligence-generated images and baselessly said Trump wasresigningbecause of his vein condition; that Trump met with abody doubleof Russian President Vladimir Putin; and that Republicans and Democrats had ""joined forces tocompletely block"" Trump's administration.

"Turning Point USA co-founder and CEO Charlie Kirk once said some prominent Black women did not have ""the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.""",True,"Kirk was speaking on his show, ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" on July 13, 2023. He was talking specifically about television presenter Joy Reid; former first lady Michelle Obama; then-U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas; and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
After the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA co-founder and CEO Charlie Kirk, a conservative commentator and ally to U.S. President Donald Trump, a rumor spread that he had once said Black women like television presenter Joy Reid; former first lady Michelle Obama; former Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas; and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson did ""not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously.""
For example, a Sept. 11, 2025,post on Xincluded a video clip of Kirk saying, ""You have to go steal a white person's slot"" (archived):
This post had 8.2 million views and 55,000 likes as of this writing. The same clip appeared inseveralInstagramposts. Further, Snopes readers searched the site and emailed seeking to confirm the rumor.
The claim was true and the video clip of Kirk saying this was authentic. Snopes identifiedan episode of ""The Charlie Kirk Show""(archived) from July 13, 2023, in which Kirk named these four Black women and said these words, adding that the admission that they had benefited from affirmative action amounted to a confession that they were not bright enough to reach prominence on their merits (the segment begins at 53:45):
If we would have said three weeks ago […] that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative-action picks, we would have been called racist. But now they're coming out and they're saying it for us! They're coming out and they're saying, ""I'm only here because of affirmative action.""
Yeah, we know. You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.
Kirk then played a clip of Jackson Lee speaking in Congress, saying she had been admitted to educational institutions on affirmative action. Kirk then went on to make his point again:
We know. We know. It's very obvious to us you are not smart enough to be able to get it on your own. ""I could not make it on my own, so I needed to take opportunities from someone more deserving.""
Snopes also has confirmed Kirksaidthe Second Amendment was ""worth"" having some gun deaths andcalledempathy a ""made-up, new age term."" We also looked into a claim that he'd saidJewish money had ruined U.S. culture. Here aresix claimsabout Kirk we've investigated."

"In late 2025, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in reference to the Republican Party and the nation: “We're killing all the right people, and we're cutting your taxes.""",True,"Graham said the above quote while expressing support for Israel's war in Gaza during remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit.
In late 2025, a rumor spread online that U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said that he felt good about the state of the Republican Party and the nation because ""we're killing all the right people.""
The rumor spread onInstagram,X,RedditandFacebook.Manypostsincluded a clip of Graham's alleged comments.
The clip was real. Graham said the aforementioned quote at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit on Oct. 31, 2025, per avideothe coalition posted on YouTube of Graham's full remarks (see 7:44). Thus, we have rated this quote a correct attribution.
Graham's speech largely focused on support for Israel amid the country's ongoing war in Gaza.
In the two years since militant group Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and capture of Israeli hostages, Israel's offensive haskilledmore than 67,000 Palestinians anddisplacedan estimated 90% of Gaza's population in what a United Nations commissiondeclaredagenocide. According to a Septembernews releasefrom global humanitarian association Save the Children, over 20,000 children have been killed.
Graham repeatedly referenced killing terrorists and Hamas militants before he said, ""We're killing all the right people."" His office did not immediately return an inquiry asking the senator to clarify whether he believed ""killing all the right people"" included Gaza's children and adult civilians.
Here's a transcript of excerpts focused on Israel and Hamas from the back half of his speech starting at thefour-minutemark, with the quote about killing the ""right people"" in bold:
We have no better friend than the state of Israel. Everybody who wants to destroy the Jewish state wants to kill us too. I've been to Israel a bunch. No one has ever said 'death to America' while I've been there. They don't wanna buy me a beer, but nobody says, 'death to America.' All the terrorists you're killing, Ron [Dermer, Israel's minister of strategic affairs], is one less terrorist that can get here.
Common values and common enemies. And if you don't get that, you should not be allowed to drive. So what to do about Hamas? Kill them off. [Laughs]
[Applause]
Kill them off.
You know why I don't have a pet tiger? There is no such thing as a pet tiger. RememberSiegfried and Roy? We're down to Siegfried. So, they had the tigers and they loved the tigers, and apparently, the tigers, they thought, loved them. They had Cleo, their favorite tiger. He lived at the house, they were teaching him to drive. And one night, for some unknown reason, he ate Roy. He's a tiger. [Laughs]
Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. They're dedicated to killing everybody who disagrees with them religiously in their own faith. And they're never gonna change. So let's get on with it. Let's make sure they can't survive and do October the 7th.
Now, I'm glad we got the hostages back. God bless that deal. I'm glad we got a ceasefire, but I'm worried Hamas is not going to play the game the way we thought they would. If you're shocked they're shooting people in the streets, you missed a lot of what they did before they got the ceasefire. I just think, give Israel some time. But there'll come a point, Ron, where we gotta just end this thing. There is no pathway forward in the Middle East as long as Hamas is around. Get them out.
[...]
Let's finish Hamas off, one way or the other.

[U.S. President Donald Trump] recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Why? Because if you got a problem with that, take it up with God. He's the guy who did it, not Trump.
So I just want to say, I feel good about the Republican Party. I feel good about where we're going as a nation. We're killing all the right people, and we're cutting your taxes.
[Laughter and applause]
Trump is my favorite president. We ran out of bombs. We didn't run out of bombs in World War II.
So, as a coalition of Republicans, some Baptist, some Jewish, we organize ourselves around principles that we love and we cherish. We love individual freedom, we love entrepreneurship. We love capitalism. We love Israel. We love the idea of Israel. We love the struggle they've been involved in. We love them — helping them because you're helping yourself. So to those who worry about these stupid interviews and far-off places, don't worry. The Republican Party has figured it out when it comes to Israel. We understand that Israel is a friend of America to the bitter end. We understand that God blesses those who bless Israel.

“Democrats have 24 more seats (in Congress) than they would have if illegal aliens were not counted in the census.”,False,"A North Carolina Republican has a theory about why Democrats oppose a bill requiring state and local government agencies to help detain people wanted by federal immigration officials.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled General Assembly hope to enact the bill, known as the ""North Carolina Border Protection Act"", after Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed it in June. They overrode Stein’s veto in the state Senate; the House of Representatives has yet to vote on an override.

State Rep.John Blust, a Guilford County Republican, said during the bill’s June 4 House debate that Democrats benefit from having a large population of people in the U.S. illegally.

""I keep thinking, 'Why are they [Democrats] choosing this hill to die on?’,""Blust said. ""And then I read a few weeks ago that: Because they count illegal aliens in the census, the Republican majority would be 27 seats in the Congress instead of three.""

What is Blust talking about?

Every 10 years, Congress redistributes the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives based on each state’s population. States gain or lose seats based on population estimates calculated by the U.S. Census. For example, the 2020 census showed North Carolina population growth, leading it to gain a fourteenth congressional seat; New York lost a seat due to population decline.

Census-takers measure only the number of people living in the U.S; they aren’t responsible for determining a person’s legal status. President Donald Trumptried to changethat prior to the 2020 census, but the Supreme Court blocked an effort to add a citizenship question to the national survey. On Aug. 7, Trumpsaidon Truth Socialthat people without legal status would not be included in census data. Blust said the practice of including immigrants illegally in the U.S. benefits states with more liberal populations.

One note about Blust’s original statement about the GOP’s majority in the U.S. House: the party’s edge has fluctuated as members have died or resigned. In an email responding to PolitiFact’s question about his comments, Blust clarified his claim.

""I have read that Democrats have 24 more seats than they would have if illegal aliens were not counted in the census,"" he wrote in a June 13 email.

Blust said he couldn’t remember where he read the statistic about Congressional apportionment and provided no evidence to support his claim.

PolitiFactfact-checkedthe theory about congressional apportionment last year after similar claims by billionaire Elon Musk, Republican congressmen, and Trump adviser Stephen Miller.

Some alleged that immigrants in the country illegally accounted for 22 U.S. House seats based on population estimates by theFederation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for reduced immigration. The federation claimed in a 2023 report that the U.S. was home to about 16.8 million such immigrants as of that June. Some people took that 16.8 million number and divided it by761,169— the number of people each congressional seat represents — to arrive at the math for 22 affected House seats.

But PolitiFact found the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s data isflawedbecause it likely overcounted the number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Other groups estimate a lower population of immigrants in the country illegally, ranging from 10.5 million to about11 million.

TheCenter for Immigration Studies, which also advocates for less immigration, has published new reports on the immigrant population sincelast year’s PolitiFact report. That group’s findings don’t support Blust’s claim, either.

The center estimated that the U.S. is home to21.6 million noncitizens, about half of whom are here illegally. It said that noncitizens — regardless of immigration status — created a net gain of14 U.S. House seatsin Democratic-leaning states in 2020. Migrants in the U.S. illegally likely affectedtwo U.S. House seatsin 2020, the group reported.

If the census were retaken in 2024, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated, migrants in the U.S. illegally would affect seven states by shiftingfour U.S. House seats: seats in Minnesota, Oregon, Ohio, and Tennessee would be redistributed to Arizona, California and Texas (which would get two new seats).

Other groups say that unauthorized immigrants have a much smaller effect on U.S. House seats.

The Pew Research Center reported in 2020 thatthree seats would shiftif unauthorized immigrants were excluded from that year’s census. California, Texas and Florida would lose a seat, while Alabama, Ohio and Minnesota would have gained one seat each.

The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said in aJanuary 2024 reportthat noncitizen populations — both legal immigrants and immigrants in the country illegally — primarily increased in Republican-led states between 2019 and 2023. Cato said red states gained an estimated 1.2 million noncitizens while blue states gained about 72,000. Cato researcher David Bier, the report’s author, told PolitiFact North Carolina in a telephone interview that Blust’s claim is ""very wrong"" and that he’s not aware of any credible study that supports Blust’s claim.

Astudypublished in January found that including immigrants in the U.S. illegally in census data has had ""minimal"" impact on party representations of the U.S. House of Representatives. The study was conducted by University of Minnesota researcherRob WarrenandRobert E. Warren, a former demographer for the U.S. Census who’s now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank studying international migration.

If immigrants in the U.S. illegally were excluded from the 2020 census, California and Texas would have each lost one seat in the 2020 House and those seats would have been given to Ohio and New York instead, Warren and Warren reported.

""Even if we were to make the most extreme possible assumption — that every ‘lost’ seat would have cost Democrats and every ‘gained’ seat would have benefitted Republicans — the number of seats switching parties could never have exceeded five,"" they wrote in their study.

Brian Gaines, a University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign political science professor, said excluding migrants in the country illegally from the census would likely cause ""a small increase in the Republican share of U.S. House seats."" However, he said, Blust’s estimate of 24 seats is ""implausibly high.""

Blust said Democrats have ""24 more seats"" in the U.S. House than they would have if immigrants in the U.S. illegally weren’t counted in the census.

Blust didn’t provide any evidence to support his claim. Estimates by researchers and advocacy groups show that immigrants in the U.S. illegally likely affect congressional apportionment — but not by as many seats as Blust said, and not benefitting Democrats as much as Blust said. At least one study shows Republican-led states benefitting more than states led by Democrats.

"Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex abuse held a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 3, 2025.",True,"Amid bipartisan pressure on U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to release additional files in the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a claim spread online that survivors of the financier's abuse planned to hold a news conference on Sept. 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C.
The rumor circulated — often alongside aphoto collageof eight women who accused Epstein of sex abuse — onplatformssuch asFacebook,X,InstagramandLinkedIn.Severalpostsclaimed that some survivors would be speaking about their experience publicly for the first time.
People who have accusedEpsteinand his associate,Ghislaine Maxwell, of abuse did, in fact, hold a news conference on Sept. 3.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., andRo Khanna, D-Calif., first announced the event in Aug. 11socialmediaposts as part of a push to pass their co-sponsoredbillto release the so-called ""Epstein files.""
One of the lawyers representing the survivors,Brad Edwards, confirmed the accuracy of Massie's and Khanna's posts via an Aug. 26 email to Snopes. Live video of the news conference on Capitol Hill was available through variousnewsmediaorganizations. Thus, we've rated this claim true.
See the fullnews conferencerecorded byABCNews below. Survivors began speaking at16:02:
Eightsurvivors spoke in person at the conference, includingMarina Lacerda, who spoke publicly about her experiences for the first time andidentifiedherself as ""Minor Victim 1"" in Epstein's 2019 indictment on sex trafficking charges (see 24:01). Family members of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most-prominent accusers, also spoke on her behalf. Giuffre's familyannouncedthat she died by suicide in April 2025.
The exact number of Epstein's victims is unclear, but there were significantly more than those who spoke at the news conference. The Department of Justice alleged in a July 2025documentthat Epstein, whodied by suicidein 2019 while awaiting trial for federal sex-traffickingcharges, ""harmed over one thousand victims.""
The survivors and Giuffre's family all called on lawmakers to pass Massie and Khanna's Epstein Files Transparency Act after Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnsonreportedlysent lawmakers home early to stall a vote on the legislation. Massie filed adischarge petitionon Sept. 2, a rare procedural tool to bypass Johnson and force a vote on the bill. As of this writing, four Republicans, including Massie, havesignedthe petition.
""I encourage my colleagues, please, there's over 200 Republicans who have not signed this discharge petition. We only need two of them to sign it. And every Democrat will sign it and that will get us the number we need to force this vote,"" Massiesaid(see 1:03:48).

"In November 2025, the U.S. Senate cut food safety regulations in a funding bill to reopen the government.",True,"After lawmakers passed a bill to fund the U.S. government on Nov. 12, 2025, ending a weeks-longshutdown, a rumor spread online that the act included major cuts to food safety laws.
The claim spread onFacebook,XandBluesky. Meanwhile, Snopes readers asked for verification of a popularpostfrom Facebook account Occupy Democrats about the rumor (screenshot).
Senate lawmakers did, in fact, pass provisions in thefunding billthat made cuts to FDA rulesaimed at preventing food contamination and foodborne illnesses, as first reported byThe Lever, an investigative news outlet.These cuts made it into the finallegislation, approved by the House of Representatives, that Trump signed into law on Nov. 12.
Thus, we have rated this claim true.
In the Senate, every Republican, seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democratsvotedfor the bill. In the House, all but two Republicansvotedin favor alongside six Democrats who broke with their party.
One Snopes reader also asked whether lawmakers passed the cuts ""because they were paid off,"" an apparent reference to the allegation that the restriction on regulations came after ""massive donations from corporate lobbyists."" Various representatives of food industries havespent millionsof dollars lobbying Congress in support of their interests, including cuts to food safety regulations. Food industry groupsalso donateto politicians.
Legally speaking, however, lobbying and donations are not the same as bribery, or being ""paid off.""
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not immediately return requests for their rationale behind reducing food safety laws.Manyindustrygroupsopposedthe rules on various grounds, including that they werenot necessaryfor food safety orburdensome.
Two sections of thelegislationmade cuts to FDA food safety regulations by prohibiting the agency from using government funds to enforce rules affecting certain kinds of produce and traceability of the food supply.
Section 735, Page 56essentially exempted the hops, wine grapes, almonds and legume (or ""pulse crops"") industries from two FDA rules. The first rule, from 2015,established""science-based minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce.""
""The rule sets forth procedures, processes, and practices that minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death,"" the summary of the 2015 rulestated. ""We expect the rule to reduce foodborne illness associated with the consumption of contaminated produce.""
The same section also exempted the aforementioned industries froma rule, finalized by the FDA but pending from taking effect as of this writing, that updated quality standards for water used on produce and farmworker hygiene practices.
Here's the full text forSection 735, Page 56 (emphasis ours):
SEC. 735.None of the fundsmade available by this or any other Act may be usedto enforcethe final rule promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration entitled ''Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption'', and published on November 27, 2015, and the proposed rule issued by the Food and Drug Administration pending at the Office of Management and Budget entitled ''Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding Produce for Human Consumption Related to Agricultural Water'' (86 Fed. Reg. 69120 and 87 Fed. Reg. 42973),with respect to the regulation of entities that grow, harvest, pack, or hold wine grapes, hops, pulse crops, or almonds.
Section 780, Page 64prohibited the FDA from enforcing any rules created in response toSection 204of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, ""Enhancing Tracking and Tracing of Food and Recordkeeping,"" until July 20, 2028. The funding bill also specifically blocked arulecalled ""Requirements for Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods.""
That rule,proposedby the first Trump administration in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic,was supposed tohelp the FDA ""rapidly and effectively identify recipients of foods to prevent or mitigate foodborne illness outbreaks and address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences or death resulting from foods being adulterated or misbranded."" Former President Joe Biden's administration finalizedthe rulein 2023.
Section 780 of the funding bill also required the FDA to engage with the ""regulated entities"" to create ""additional flexibilities"" — in other words, looser regulations — in connection with the traceability rules.
Here'sthat sectionin full on Page 64 (emphasis ours):
SEC. 780.No funds appropriated by this Act may be used to administer or enforce the ''Requirements for Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods'', published on November 21, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 70910), orany other rule promulgated in accordance with section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act(21 U.S.C. 2223),prior to July 20, 2028. Further, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration shall:
(1)Engage quarterly with the regulated entities, including farms, restaurants, retail food establishments, and warehouses distributing to retail food establishments and restaurants,to identify and implement, as appropriate, additional flexibilitiesfor satisfying the rule's lot-level tracking requirement, as appropriate, such that regulated entities can comply with the November 21, 2022, rule consistent with section 204(d)(1)(L)(iii), which prohibits the agency from requiring product tracking to the case level.
(2) Within 180 days of enactment of this Act,the Food and Drug Administration is directed to provide industry stakeholders with recommendations for these additional flexibilitiessatisfying the rule's lot-level tracking requirement, as appropriate.
(3) The FDA shall provide assistance to industry regarding how to handle food waste recovery, reclamation, intra-company transfers, customer returns under the rule and initiate a series of hypothetical data intake exercises to test the capabilities of the FDA's Product Tracing System and, upon request and as resources allow, the covered entity systems and identify any technical difficulties prior to full implementation.
In sum, the funding bill that reopened the government — introduced by Senate Republicans and signed into law by Trump on Nov. 12 — included provisions that delayed, weakened or prohibited FDA enforcement of ongoing and pending food safety regulations. The regulations affected included safety and hygiene standards for handling produce and enhanced recordkeeping for certain parts of the food chain supply."
"U.S. President Donald Trump's October 2025 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza was the ""exact deal"" brokered by former President Joe Biden.",False,"In January 2025, Biden announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire and hostage-exchange deal. Israel broke the agreement with surprise airstrikes about two months later.
On Oct. 8, 2025, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza.
The agreement came two years afterHamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which the militant group killed 1,200 people and captured 251 hostages. Israel's ensuing offensivekilledmore than 67,000 Palestinians anddisplacedan estimated 90% of Gaza's population in what a United Nations commissiondeclaredagenocide.
Following theceasefireannouncement, a rumor spread online that Trump used a deal brokered by former President Joe Biden to try to stop the fighting. Some claims referenced a May 2024 proposal by Biden, while others claimed Trump's plan matched a ceasefire agreement that Israel and Hamas signed in January 2025 under Biden's presidency. Keith Edwards, a Democratic strategist, made the claimon X,writing:
Joe Biden had a peace deal in place, and then Netanyahu and Trump met in Mar-a-Lago and decided that keeping the war going would benefit them both.
Ten months later, they're signing the exact deal Biden brokered.
Other postson X,Facebook,RedditandBlueskyspread similar claims.
While Trump's plan had similarities with Biden's ceasefire plans, they were not the same. Namely, Biden and Trump's plans differed in how quickly the hostages would be released. Furthermore, the implication that Trump stole Biden's proposal fails to consider how circumstances, both on the ground in Gaza and politically across the globe, have changed over months.
As such, we have rated this claim false.
Furthermore,while Trump didmeetwith Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago in July 2024,as some social media posts claimed, there was no evidence the two leaders agreed on extending the war for their mutual benefit during that conversation. Netanyahu's visit with Trump had ""widely been viewed as an effort to mend ties with Trump before the November 5 election,"" according toAl Jazeera.
Biden firstannounceda ceasefire proposal in May 2024. He characterized it as an offer from Israel, but neitherHamasnorIsraelpublicly agreedto it at that time.Criticsandjournalistssaid theproposalwas essentially the same asone suggestedby Egypt and Qatar in April and endorsed by Hamas.
Then, on Jan. 16, 2025 — after Trump won the presidency but before Biden left office — Bidenannouncedthat Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire and hostage-exchange deal.
""This — this is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring,"" Bidensaidin his announcement, referencing his initial May 2024 proposal. ""Today, Hamas and Israel have agreed to that ceasefire agreement and the whole — ending the war.""
The peace lasted until March, when Israelbrokethe ceasefire agreement through surprise airstrikes that, according to theGaza Health Ministry, killed more than 400 Palestinians.
At the time,familiesofhostages,criticsof the Israeli prime minister andjournalistssaidNetanyahu restarted the war to prolong his political survival, an allegation the prime ministerrejectedas ""malicious and also false.""Someanalystsalso said Netanyahu violated the ceasefire because he thought he could get a better deal with Trump in the White House.
Netanyahu's officeclaimedthe March strikes happened because Hamas refused Israel'sdemandto release half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for continuingthe ceasefiredeal as planned. (Hamas reportedlycalled onIsrael to adhere to the original ceasefire planas signed.)
Over the spring and summer, Israel continued to bombard Gaza, killingmore than15,000 Palestinians, according to U.N. reports compiling Gaza Ministry of Health data.
Then, on Sept. 29, Trumpannounceda new ceasefire plan alongside Netanyahu. In an Oct. 3 Truth Socialpost, Trump gave Hamas an Oct. 5 deadline to agree to the deal's terms or face ""all HELL.""
On Oct. 8, TrumpannouncedIsrael and Hamas had ""signed off"" on the first phase of his deal.
In short, the biggest difference between Biden's and Trump's ceasefire deals was the timeline for swapping captives.
Under Trump'sdeal(archived), published in full on the White House's X account and in news outlets,including the New York Times, Hamas released 20remainingIsraeli hostages in exchange for 1,700 detainees from Gaza who Israel haddetainedwithout charge,reportedlyinabusiveconditions. Israel alsoreleased250 convicted prisoners, many of whom had affiliations with Hamas or Hamas' rival, Fatah, a secular Palestinian political party.
Hamasfreedthe last group of living hostages on Oct. 13, less than a week after Trump's ceasefire deal announcement.
In contrast, Biden's plan called for the captives' release over a longer span of time. Hesaidin January that hisproposalincluded ""the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded"" in a first phase lasting six weeks. In exchange, Israelwould""release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.""
Biden never publicly released the full text of his May 2024 proposal, nor the framework that he described as a ceasefire deal in January 2025. However, The Times of Israel reportedly obtained copies ofbothplans. A Congressional Research Serviceinformation pagebyMiddle Eastspecialistscalled the Times of Israel's report a ""reputed text."" Furthermore, the United Nations Security Council passed aresolutionendorsing Biden's May 2024 proposal, and the information in that endorsement aligned with the reported copies of the former president's deal.
Bidensaidhis January 2025 proposal was ""the exact framework"" as the May 2024 plan, and that the previous plan""laid out the precise contours""of the later one.
As such, using the May 2024text(archived), Biden's plan reportedly involved a detailed step-by-step release of captives. For example, thedealdirected Hamas to release three Israeli female civilian hostages on Day 1, four additional female hostages on Day 7 and then three more detainees every seven days.
In other words, unlike Trump's deal, Hamas did not have to release all hostages immediately under Biden's plan. The former president's plancalled forreleasing remaining hostages during its second phase and the remains of hostages who had died in the third.
Following Trump's announcement of a ceasefire deal in October 2025, former secretary of stateAntony Blinken,who worked under Biden,wrote on X(archived) that Trump ""adopted and built on the plan the Biden Administration developed."" As Blinken suggested, Trump and Biden's plans had similarities — but they were not the exact same.
(Snopes illustration)
Notably, the proposals diverted in their approach to timing Israel's withdrawal from Gaza. Trump'splanalso addressed specifics regarding Hamas' future in the region, the transition of governance and the United States' role in redeveloping the enclave.
For example,bothplansnecessitatedIsraeli military  presencealong Gaza's border initially, but Trump's plan stated the military would remain there until Gazais ""securefrom any resurgent terror threat"" (it was unclear who would make that call). Trump's plan also involved Israel progressively handing over control of Gaza to a body made up of the U.S. and ""Arab and international partners.""
Bothplanscalled for immediate, unobstructed aid into Gaza and cooperation with the U.N. and other agencies. Trump's deal directly referred to Biden'sproposed aid metrics – such as 600 trucks of aid per day, 200,000 tents, etc. –as well as guidance on transportation and the flow of goods through the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.
The third phase of Biden'sproposalrequireda ""reconstruction"" period of three to five years, calling for the building of homes, civilian facilities and other infrastructure. Trump's plan focused on the ""redevelopment"" of Gaza that, according to the proposal, would consider ""many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas.""
Regarding governance, Trump'sframeworkrequired ""Hamas and other factions"" to relinquish any direct or indirect role in governing Gaza and decommission all weapons using aninternational buyback program.(Hamas, as of this writing, had not agreed to those terms.) In Hamas' place, Trumpproposeda transitional government of ""apolitical"" Palestinians with relevant expertise under the supervision of a ""Board of Peace"" chaired by himself. He also called for training ""vetted Palestinian police forces"" in Gaza as a ""long-term internal security solution.""
Biden's plan did not include any details regarding the future governance of Gaza, only that a number of countries and organizations including Egypt, Qatar and the U.N. would supervise reconstruction.
Even if Trump had used Biden's ""exact deal,"" suggesting that Trump repurposed or stole Biden's blueprint for himself ignores an evolving global political landscape in the backdrop of negotiations.
In July, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the foremost authority on global food security,declaredthe ""worst case scenario"" of famine was unfolding in Gaza.
Human-rightsgroupssuch asAmnesty Internationalconcluded that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza beforeBiden's ceasefire agreement in January.After that, between the release of Biden's and Trump's deals, a growing chorus of politicians and organizations declared Israel's actions in Gaza a genocide, including aUnited Nations commission, theInternational Association of Genocide Scholarsand twoprominentIsraelihuman-rights groups.
Global protest over the Isreali military's actions in Gaza escalated; the world watched as Israelarrestedhundreds of civilians from more than 44 nations on a Gaza-bound flotilla, including climate activistGreta Thunberg.
In September 2025, many U.S. allies,including the U.K., France, Canada and Australia, announced they recognizeda Palestinian state. (Trump's plan recognized the Palestinian ""aspiration"" for statehood.)
In the United States, public views toward Israel's military actions in Gaza steadilyshiftedtoward disapproval, according to a Pew Researchsurvey.The poll found 39% of Americans felt in September 2025 that Israel ""is going too far in its military operation against Hamas,"" up from 31% in September 2024.
Furthermore, analystssuggestedthat Trump, with strong support from his base at home andhigh popularityin Israel, may have had more flexibility in his dealmaking than Biden. Experts alsopointedto Trump's history of business with the Middle East and close ties to Gulf leaders as reasons he might have secured his deal in October 2025.
As previously stated, Israel violated Biden's ceasefire deal before its second phase.
Hamas and Israel have agreed only to the first phase of Trump's plan. As of this writing, it was impossible to say whether the ceasefire would hold.
Just days after Israel and Hamas signed Trump's agreement, IsraelaccusedHamas of violating the ceasefire by failing to return the hostages' bodies. HamasaccusedIsrael of breaking the ceasefire by killing 24 people and Israelhas reportedlylimited aid into Gaza.
In sum, the major difference between the two plans was the pace of releasing captives. And while both plans touched on redevelopment options and a transitional government for the region, Biden's proposal included less details.
That said, Trump's plan might change as negotiations continue, making it difficult to conclude, exactly, how much the plans overlap."
"Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes declared he would boycott the 2026 Super Bowl if organizers allowed rapper Bad Bunny to perform at the halftime show, and would choose instead to honor slain Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.",False,"A rumor circulating online in October 2025 claimed Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, declared he would boycott the 2026 Super Bowl if organizers allowed Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny to perform at the halftime show.
According to a popularposton the Sunday at Arrowhead Facebook page, Mahomes said he planned to join the conservative organization Turning Point USA to honor its slain co-founder, Charlie Kirk, who wasfatally shotSept. 10, 2025. Mahomes allegedly added, ""I'm an American — I'd rather be part of something All-American than the NFL's circus.""
The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation previouslyannouncedBad Bunny's headline role at the Super Bowl's halftime festivities Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Turning Point USA alsoannouncedwhat it dubbed as ""The All American Halftime Show,"" with aflyerpromising a celebration of ""faith, family and freedom.""
In short, searches ofBing,DuckDuckGoandGooglefound no news media outlets, sports-centric or otherwise, confirming Mahomes made any negative remarks about Bad Bunny's upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Those searches also did not produce any results about Mahomes issuing public remarks saying he planned to forgo the NFL's halftime show and instead honor Kirk.
The person or people who primarily promoted the false claim — residing in Vietnam, according to Facebook-provided ""page transparency""data— fabricated the tale as one of hundreds of stories depicting celebrities and athletes commenting on political hot topics.

A separate false claim circulating on other Facebook pages said Mahomes intended to boycott the Super Bowl regarding ""Bad Bunny's LGBT image,"" including demanding ""an American artist.""

The post, receiving nearly 400,000 total reactions, comments and shares, featured a text caption reading:
BREAKING: Patrick Mahomes caused a stir after declaring he would boycott the Super Bowl if organizers still let Bad Bunny perform at the halftime show. He said he would instead join Turning Point USA to honor Charlie Kirk, adding a pointed remark:
""I'm an American — I'd rather be part of something All-American than the NFL's circus.""
His statement has sparked a wave of controversy, with fans flooding social media with mixed reactions.

Pharmaceutical companies behind weight loss and diabetes medication such as Ozempic are facing a lawsuit that could potentially pay out more than $2 billion.,True,"There is multidistrict litigation, or an MDL, in progress against pharmaceutical companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Co. from parties allegedly suffering side effects caused by the active ingredient in Ozempic and other similar drugs used for type 2 diabetes and weight loss.
There is no public evidence that the potential payout could be more than $2 billion. Reports featuring these numbers cite unnamed analysts but offer no documentation arriving at this number. A number of lawsuits are continuing to be filed under the MDL, which will mean the ultimate payout amount is in flux until all cases are settled. As of August 2025, there were more than 2,600 cases, with the number expected to grow.
A rumor that pharmaceutical companies behind popular weight-loss and diabetes medications like Ozempic faced lawsuits totaling more than $2 billion circulated online in August 2025.
The claim was spread by users across social media platforms such asFacebook(archived)andX(archived,archived), with some sharing a June 2025 advisory from theWorld Health Organizationthat declared some of these medications could lead to a condition that is the ""leading cause of vision loss in adults and the second most common optic neuropathy after glaucoma.""
Though the alleged lawsuit included a variety of drugs that serve similar purposes, Ozempic was the most widely mentioned due itspopularity. According to itswebsite, ""Ozempic is a medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes that, along with diet and exercise, may improve blood sugar. While not for weight loss, Ozempic may help you lose some weight."" The drug was first approved for use by theFederal Drug Administrationin 2017.
Claims of lawsuits against Ozempic and similar drugs are indeed true. However, there is no publicly available evidence regarding the potential settlement amounts. Therefore, we have rated this claim as mostly true until we can determine the amount of money involved.
Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, as well as Eli Lilly and Co., which manufactures Trulicity and Mounjaro, faced several personal-injury lawsuits based on alleged side effects caused by GLP-1 agonists. GLP-1 agonists are drugs ""used to treat type 2 diabetes and support weight loss by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone,"" according toDrugs.com.
The Novo Nordisk products use a GLP-1 calledsemaglutide(used in Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus) while the Eli Lilly drugs use GLP-1s calleddulaglutideandtirzepatide(used in Trulicity and Mounjaro, respectively). Because of their similarities, the lawsuits were collected under a multidistrict litigation. MDLs are commonly used for complex cases with similar complaints from a multitude of claimants, such as claims related to health issues caused byasbestos products.
According to theEastern District of Pennsylvania, whose Judge Karen Spencer Marston is overseeing the Ozempic case, an MDL is ""litigation comprised of multiple civil cases involving one or more common questions of fact, but the cases are pending in different districts. Such actions may be transferred to any single district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.""
Very basically, this means a judge can make a single ruling that can then apply to other cases included in the MDL.
The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, the body that decides whether cases should be reclassified in such a manner,saidof its decision to classify the case as an MDL:
Each lawsuit contains substantially similar allegations about GLP-1 RAs (specifically, Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, Trulicity, and/or Mounjaro) and their alleged propensity to cause gastrointestinal injuries … [and] [a]ll actions share common issues of fact regarding whether defendants knew or should have known that their GLP-1 RA products can cause gastroparesis and other gastrointestinal injuries, whether defendants adequately warned plaintiffs or their prescribing physicians about the alleged dangers of these products, and whether defendants made false, misleading, or incomplete representations regarding the safety of these products.
According to the websiteLawsuit Tracker, as of August 2025 the GLP-1 multidistrict litigation, also referred to asMDL 3094, was in its early stages, with people still filing lawsuits.
This is likely the reasonGoogle searchesfor ""Ozempic lawsuit"" primarily return results from personal-injury law firms making the case known to potential clients, hoping to attract others to join the lawsuit and ultimately earn the firms a payout.
For instance, in addition to gastrointestinal injuries, one personal injury law firm pointed out arecent studythat also linked ""a serious eye injury known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,"" known as NAION, to the drug. The same law firm alsoposted:
You may qualify to file a claim if:
-You were prescribed Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, or Mounjaro
-You experienced gastroparesis, ileus, gallbladder disease, vision loss, or other serious complications
-You have medical records confirming diagnosis and treatment
-You have not signed a liability waiver or accepted prior compensation
Even if your symptoms resolved, you may still be eligible based on pain, suffering, and medical costs incurred.
The officialOzempic websitelisted a variety of possible side effects from the medication, including ""changes in vision,"" ""severe stomach problems"" and ""dehydration leading to kidney problems,"" while adding, ""the most common side effects of Ozempic may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach (abdominal) pain, and constipation.""
A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Snopes via email:
Semaglutide has been extensively examined in robust clinical development programs, large real-world-evidence studies and has cumulatively over 33 million patient years of exposure. Semaglutide's efficacy and safety have been extensively demonstrated in people with obesity/overweight with robust evidence for improving health outcomes. Semaglutide has demonstrated improvements in CV death, stroke and myocardial infarction.
Novo Nordisk believes that the allegations in the lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Patient safety is our top priority at Novo Nordisk, and we work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to continuously monitor the safety profile of our medicines. Novo Nordisk remains confident in the benefit-risk profile of our GLP-1 medicines, when used consistent with their indications and product labeling.
A spokesperson for Eli Lilly old Snopes via email, ""This week, the MDL Court issued an opinion excluding plaintiffs' experts. Lilly appreciates the Court's careful consideration of threshold issues related to the diagnosis of gastroparesis and the need for reliable science to support plaintiffs' claims. We will continue to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.""
Indeed, in a memorandum issued Aug. 15, 2025, the court ruled that two experts cited by the plaintiffs were to be excluded from the proceedings. However, the court also agreed to the plaintiff's motion to supplement, which means additional evidence may be added in support of the claimants. The memorandum noted:
The Court recognizes that given this ruling, some Plaintiffs in this MDL will be unable to prove that they suffered from gastroparesis because their diagnosis was not based on a properly performed gastric emptying study. Although unfortunate, it would be perhaps more unjust to hold Defendants potentially liable for damages based on an unreliable diagnosis. For that reason, courts in other cases have rejected similar claims where the plaintiffs were unable to prove the cause of their illness because their treating physician failed to perform a necessary test at the time of diagnosis.
The memorandum also noted these decisions ""will have relatively little effect on the vast majority of the cases in this MDL.""
As for the amount of damages at stake in the litigation, the $2 billion figure appeared to originate with the law firm of Melinda J. Helbock, whosewebsitestated ""analysts project total liability could exceed $2 billion as new claims surge."" The website did not give more information about the analysts or how they arrived at that number.
However, there is no public evidence that this number is accurate. When asked about the potential amount at stake in the MDL, a law clerk for presiding U.S. District Judge Karen Marston told Snopes in an email, ""It is Judge Marston's policy not to comment on pending cases, whether it be specific inquiries or more general inquiries.""
It is unlikely an accurate figure will be available until the MDL is concluded, which could potentially take years.
In conclusion, while the lawsuit brought against Ozempic and similar drugs is authentic, there is no evidence of what the potential windfall could be should the plaintiffs succeed."
"On Aug. 25, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller called the Democratic Party a ""domestic, extremist organization"" on Fox News.",True,"On Aug. 25, 2025,according to postson social media, U.S. President Donald Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called the Democratic party a ""domestic, extremist organization"" on live television.
Using such language to describe the opposition party to the current presidential administrationstartled many online,some of whom called Miller'srhetoric ""fascist.""Snopes readers searched the site wondering if Miller had indeed said those words.
He did. The claim is true.
Miller appeared on Fox News' ""Hannity"" to talk about ""how Democrats have let crime run rampant in Chicago,""according to a Fox News clip of his comments. (According toChicago's NBC affiliate WMAQ, Chicago Police Department statistics show the city saw a 21.9% decrease in violent crime in 2024).
The appearance followed Trump'sAug. 11 decisionto station national guard troops in Washington, D.C., in order to, as he said, decrease crime andcomments suggestingthat Chicagoand other cities with mayors from the Democratic party might follow.
Hannity introduced Miller with the following remarks:
You know Steven, I've been running a scroll of the names of people that have been shot and shot and killed. You could predict with pinpoint accuracy how many people on any given weekend are going to be shot and shot and killed in Chicago. They haven't lifted a finger to solve the problem.
You know, they've fallen in to this ""defund,"" ""dismantle,"" ""reimagine,"" ""no-bail"" insanity. And now Donald Trump wants to help and they're mad at him?
Over a chyron that read ""Dems fall on the wrong side of every issue,"" Miller responded as follows (emphasis added):
Look, we discussed this last time I was on your show. The Democrat party does not fight for, care about or represent American citizens. It is an entity devoted exclusively to the defense of hardened criminals, gangbangers, and illegal alien killers and terrorists.The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic, extremist organization.
Look at Chicago. They've shut down the police department, they've handcuffed law enforcement, and as President Trump says, they have turned the streets of Chicago into a bloody killing field.
Here in Washington, D.C., before President Trump launched the federal law enforcement liberation in D.C., there was a murder on the streets of this town every other day — body after body after body after body. That was Washington, D.C. Residents were afraid to go to restaurants, they were afraid to go into entire neighborhoods, they were getting carjacked right and left, robbed and beaten. That was Washington, D.C.
Now we're two weeks homicide free — the safest the city has ever been in its entire history. And the Democrats, instead of jumping up and down and saying, ""Thank you President Trump, thank you for saving our lives, thank you for saving our cities, thank you for scrubbing away all the graffiti, the trash, the homeless encampments, the druggies"" — instead of cleaning up the city, instead of thanking him for that, they're saying, ""President Trump, how dare you save our lives, how dare you save our children, how dare you save our city.""
The Democrat party, Sean, that exists today, it disgusts me. I do not recognize that party, Sean.
In Trump's first administration,Millerserved as a senior policy adviser and speechwriter.According to The Guardian, he was the architect behind several of Trump's ""most notorious policy initiatives,"" including the ""Muslim ban"" on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017. As of this writing, he serves as Trump's deputy chief of staff of policy andhomeland security adviser."
U.S. President Donald Trump once said the U.S. and Italy have been allies since ancient Rome.,False,"In early September 2025, aclaimspreadonsocial mediathat U.S. President Donald Trump once said the U.S. and Italy have been allies since ancient Rome.
One Facebookpost(archived), for example, attracted thousands of comments and reactions, with the caption, ""Trump said that the United States and Italy have been allies since the time of Ancient Rome. Translator's reaction is priceless!""
Numerous social mediaaccountshave spread the claim over years, on platforms such asX,LinkedIn,Threads,Instagram,YouTubeandFacebook.
In short, Trump did not claim that the United States and Italy have been allies since ancient Rome. He remarked that the two countries have a ""shared cultural and political heritage"" dating back back thousands of years. As such, we have rated this claim as false.
We previouslydebunked this rumor back in 2019and2024, highlighting that such an assertion would obviously be incorrect, as the United States was not founded as anindependent nation until 1776, and Italy did not achieveunificationuntil the 19th century, becoming a republic only in the 1940s.
The claim originated from a speech Trump gave during ajoint press conferencewith Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Oct. 16, 2019. During the event, Trump made the following statement: ""The United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years, to ancient Rome.""
Right after that, Trump stated: ""Over the centuries the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent work of art, science, philosophy, architecture, music."" He continued: ""On Monday we pay tribute to the Italian explorer who led a voyage of discovery to the New World, a gentleman known as Christopher Columbus. And to me it will always be called Columbus Day. Some people don't like that, I do.""
Therefore, Trump stated that the United States and Italy share a political and cultural heritage dating back thousands of years, but did not claim they had been allied for that long. Trump's use of the phrase ""dating back thousands of years"" seems to have caused confusion, leading some to misinterpret his remarks.
The influence of the Roman Republic on the formation and principles of the American Republic iswell-documented, making Trump's point historically accurate.
Moreover, the images shared in posts spreading the false claim, allegedly showing ""the translator's reaction,"" were not taken during Trump's misinterpreted comments about Italy. Instead, they were captured that same day in a different location — at theOval Officeof the White House.
For instance, one photo appeared to be a screenshot from the video titled ""OVAL OFFICE: President Trump FULL Meeting With Italian President""sharedon Oct. 16, 2019, by LiveNOW from FOX YouTube channel:
The image circulating in 2025 appeared to be a digitally enhanced remake of anolder collage, with noticeably smoother textures and exaggerated facial features, as shown in the image below:

A study published in October 2025 found that vaping products contained bacteria that indicated fecal contamination.,True,"The study looked into a specific sample of vaping products in Virginia schools during the 2024-25 school year. It found some of the devices contained traces of coliform - a bacteria that indicates fecal matter contamination. However, these were devices ""that had been confiscated or found on school premises,"" not new, unopened vapes. This indicated that contamination was due to the product’s handling and storage. The researchers behind the study confirmed via email that no contamination was found in the unopened products they tested.
In fall 2025, a rumor circulated online that scientists found fecal contamination in vaping products during a study published in October.
Grossed-out social media userson X(archived),Facebook(archived) andInstagram(archived) shared the alleged revelation, with onesaying: ""In other words, vape users are literally inhaling toilet microbes — plus nicotine and drug-like additives."" The X user added:
Scientists found fecal contamination and E. coli in vapes.
American researchers examined nearly 1,300 vapes taken from school students in Virginia. Their goal was to show young people what they are actually inhaling.
Most devices contained nicotine, and some had cannabinoids, often a mix of synthetic and plant-based compounds.
But the most disgusting and dangerous part: several vapes contained bacteria, yeast, and E. coli, indicating fecal contamination. In some cases, the levels exceeded safe limits.
A post shared by Success Addictives (@successaddictives)
While it was true that scientists found fecal contamination in vapes, some of the social media users omitted critical context, such as how many devices were contaminated and whether the products were used or unused.
Below we outline the study and provide the crucial details about the fecal findings:
On Oct. 30, 2025,Virginia Commonwealth University published an article saying its forensic toxicology research lab carried outthe study in question. It analyzed a specific sample of ""nearly 1,300 products[collected] from K-12 schools in Virginia""during the 2024-25 school year""as part of a project that exposes the ingredients in thousands of unregulated vapes and cannabis products.""
The team foundthat ""microbiologicals, such as bacteria, yeast"" andcoliform— a bacteria that indicates fecal matter contamination — were present in some of the devices tested,many of which exceeded ""the exposure threshold — meaning that they rise above the level of exposure at which health effects are likely to occur, raising significant concerns about the potential side effects from vaping on user health.""
ProfessorMichelle Peace, one of the VCU researchers who conducted the study, echoed this via email, adding: ""Coliform is a large class of bacteria known to be present in the small intestines of mammals."" She said its presence ""is used to indicate some contamination with fecal matter and the risk that a more serious bacterial pathogen, such as E.coli, could be present. Inhaling coliform and other bacteria can lead to inflamed lung tissue and pneumonia.""
However, Peace said the devices tested ""had been confiscated or found on school premises"" and therefore were not new, unopened vaping products.While vapes can contain other unhealthy chemicals like nicotine, she noted: ""When we assessed a small number of products we purchased ourselves and sampled immediately after opening, no vapes were contaminated.""
This indicated that contamination was due to the products' handling and storage.According to Peace, given that some of the devices were contaminated, ""consumers need to be thoughtful about where and how they store/keep their devices and washing their hands after using the bathroom.""
""The reason is that people do not wash their hands or wash them well before they handle something else,"" she continued. ""Additionally, vapes are carried in back pockets, where they may remain while someone uses the bathroom. Many vapes we have received from school systems are also found in the bathrooms, behind and in toilets, in the toilet paper dispenser, in garbage cans, above the ceiling panels.""
""These locations are going to be full of coliform, which can potentially transfer to the vaping device, which is, itself, sticky,"" Peace added, before saying that ""any count of coliform colonies in an inhaled product is considered a failed test.The U.S. Pharmacopeia, General Chapter <1111>, requires an absence of bile-tolerant, gram negative bacteria, which includes coliform. No amount of coliform is allowed in inhaled products.""
So while it was true that contaminants indicating the presence of fecal matter were found in some vaping products during the research, the study itself highlighted the contaminants that were present due to the handling of the products, rather than those present at the time of purchase.
For further reading on finding bacteria in unexpected places, Snopes previously investigated the claim thatcellphones are dirtier than toilet seats. In sum, wash your hands and do not take products you put in or near your mouth into the bathroom."
"Conservative activist Charlie Kirk once described Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager acquitted of killing two people and wounding another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as ""a hero to millions.”",True,"Kirk introduced Rittenhouse during a panel, titled, “Kenosha on Camera,” at “AmericaFest 2021,” an event put on by Turning Point USA, an organization Kirk co-founded. The panel featuring the quote in question took place on Dec. 20, 2021.
In the days following the assassination of Turning Point USA co-founderCharlie Kirkin early September 2025, social media exploded with rumors about the late conservative activist, including purported quotes.
One such claim circulating across social media sites likeInstagram(archived),X(archived), andparticularlyonFacebook(archived,archived,archived), was that Kirk once introduced Kyle Rittenhouse at a Turning Point USA event as ""a hero to millions."" Many of the posts sharing the rumor also included alleged photos of the two men together.
Rittenhouse was an Illinois teenager who waschargedwith, and lateracquittedof, homicide and reckless endangerment after hefatally shottwo people and wounded another duringa Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug, 25, 2020.
The quote is correctly attributed to Kirk. He introduced Rittenhouse at a panel, titled, ""Kenosha on Camera,"" on Dec. 20, 2021, at a Turning Point USA event called ""AmericaFest 2021.""
Following Kirk's introduction and the crowd chanting Rittenhouse's name, Kirk said:
Kyle, I just got to say that what you went through, where they tried to destroy your life, the media tried to destroy you, the current president right now called you a white supremacist … and Kyle, the way you held it all together, you're a hero to millions and and it's an honor to be able to have you here.
Snopespreviouslyfact-checked the ""white supremacist"" comment Kirk alluded to in this statement and found it to be mostly true.
Videos of the ""Kenosha on Camera"" panel are available on YouTube from a variety of users and attendees, all showing anidenticalsequenceofeventsfrom different angles. On the same date, a user onX(archived) posted a behind-the-scenes moment of Rittenhouse as he prepared to be called out on stage by Kirk.
In the video below, the quote in question begins at 1:35.
Further,Rittenhouse's acquittalhad dominated headlines a month prior to ""AmericaFest 2021,"" and journalists covered his appearance at the event extensively.
For instance,Rolling Stone,SalonandEsquireran Op-Ed pieces about conservatives' ""lionizing"" of Rittenhouse.The Washington Post,Newsweek,The Guardian,the New York Postand local Arizona outletAZ Centralreported on Rittenhouse's appearance and warm reception at the event.
Snopes has fact-checked a variety of claims surrounding Kirk after he wasfatally shotin Utah on Sept. 10, 2025.
For example, we've looked into rumors that he allegedly oncesaidif he had a 10-year-old daughter who became pregnant after being raped he'd want her to deliver the baby, that hecalledMartin Luther King Jr. ""an awful person"" and that hesaidgay people should be stoned to death."

Those users aimed to earn advertising revenue on the blogs linked from the aforementioned Facebook posts.
TPUSA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet told Snopes via email, ""This is a fake story and not true.""
One of the aforementioned WordPressarticles, hosted on Top News Source — a website we previouslyreportedhas managers residing in Vietnam — displayed several signs of AI. For example, the ending of the story resembled the same dramatized way that AI tools have historically concluded similar tales. That conclusion read as follows:
As the nation mourns his death, Americans find comfort in knowing that Charlie Kirk did not spend his final days under pressure—but in peace. Not in division—but in love. Not as an icon—but as a father.
And perhaps that is how he would want to be remembered.
Not for the battles he fought in public—but for the love he poured out in private.
The aforementioned AI-generatedvideobrought to life an AI-generated picture of Kirk writing on paper, as well as a genuine photo of the Kirks and their children. The fake image of Kirk writing on paper displayed one primary sign of AI — the overly shiny and smooth look of her skin.

The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel.,True,"Ask a Wisconsinite to name something that gets their blood boiling, and it’s a safe bet the answer will be about politics or the sports teams to our south.

A recent X post raises the question: What about both?

First, a little context: Wisconsin residentswill head to the polls April 1for the next in our seemingly endless cycle of consequential elections, casting a vote for either liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford or conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel to serve on the state Supreme Court.

The winner will determine whether the ideological tilt of the court will remain skewed liberal, which has been the casesince the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023, or if it will return to a conservative majority, as it had been for 15 years prior. With such high stakes, experts believe the contest will produce a record-breaking level of spending, including from notable individuals and groups outside the campaigns themselves.

X user Kid Riles pointed outone such individual.

""To all the Milwaukee Brewers fans who live in Wisconsin: The Chicago Cubs owner is bankrolling Brad Schimel,"" the post reads. ""Vote accordingly.""

We periodically look at claims related to politics that are circulating on social media. So, is the owner of the Cubs really bankrolling Schimel’s campaign?

Let’s take a look.

We’ll get the baseball trivia out of the way first. The Ricketts family, headed by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts,owns the Cubs. Joe’s son Tom is the team’schairman.

A look at Schimel’spublicly available campaign finance reportsdoes not show the Ricketts in his list of donors.

So what gives? The explanation requires some knowledge of campaign finance law in Wisconsin over the past decade.

The state’s campaign finance laws cap the amount that a person can give to a Supreme Court candidate to $20,000. But under a change the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislaturemade in 2015, political parties can receive unlimited donations, which they can funnel to their preferred candidates. (That change has ultimatelybenefited Democrats morebecause they have been able to raise more money.)

A review of the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s campaign finance reportsshows a Jan. 27, 2025 donation from Joe Rickettsof $500,000. After receiving this and other large donations from wealthy individuals, Republican party officialstransferred nearly $1.7 millionin three donations to Schimel’s campaign.

It’s illegalfor a donor to give to the party and say they expect it to flow to a certain candidate, meaning it’s impossible to definitively prove that Ricketts’ money was for Schimel.

Still, this practice has become a tried-and-true way for donors to get around individual contribution limits — so much so that Schimel encouraged people to do it.

At a Calumet County Republican Party event last July, Schimel urged those who could afford to give more than $20,000 to give to the state party instead,the Journal Sentinel previously reported, suggesting any money given after the Nov. 5, 2024 election would be transferred to him.

""If you want to give a lot more, you can give that to either of the state parties, and they can transfer it,"" he said. ""They can transfer that to candidates.""

(The Wisconsin Democracy Campaignfiled an ethics complaintin early February over this remark and others by Schimel, who is prohibited by law from personally soliciting campaign donations.)

The state Democratic Party has also made use of this playbook. In January, theyreceived$1 million from billionaire George Soros; $500,000 from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker; $490,000 from Milwaukee philanthropist Lynde Uihlein; $470,000 from retired software engineer Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and $250,000 from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Weeks after receiving those donations, theytransferred $2 million in three donationsto Crawford’s campaign.

Now, for the nitty-gritty: the X post claims Ricketts is ""bankrolling"" Schimel. The dictionary definition of bankroll is ""to supply money for,"" but it’s worth noting that Ricketts is not supplying the majority of the funds in this extraordinarily expensive race.

ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks gave $970,000 to the state Republican party in January, and Uline president Liz Uihlein gave $650,000. Even groups backed by Elon Muskhave dropped a few millionon TV ads and increasing voter turnout for Schimel.

All told, spending on this election is expected to outpace spending on Wisconsin’s last Supreme Court election in 2023, whichtotaled more than $56 millionandshattered national spending records.

A post on social media claimed Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts is bankrolling Schimel.

A review of campaign finance records shows Ricketts gave a large sum to the state GOP, which has alongside Democrats transferred money to preferred candidates in a well-known workaround of individual contribution limits — something Schimel has acknowledged outright.

Thus, the claim is largely accurate, though it’s missing the context of that workaround, which means we can’t know with complete certainty that Ricketts intended the money for Schimel.

Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

That fits here."

"In September 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump shared a meme on Truth Social with the caption, ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""",True,"In September 2025,socialmediausersbegan sharing a meme about Chicago deportations that they claimed U.S. President Donald Trump posted on his official Truth Social account.
According to those posts, the alleged meme depicted Trump as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the movie ""Apocalypse Now,"" with a caption that read, ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""The quote referenced Kilgore's iconic line from the film: ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""
The meme circulated online amidTrump's controversial plans to deploy National Guard troops and federal agentsin Chicago as part of his administration's ongoing immigration crackdown.
""Not to sound like a crazy person, but the president declared WAR on the third largest city in the United States of America via tweet,"" a Threads userposted(archived) on Sept. 7.
The claim about Trump posting the meme also circulatedon XandReddit(archivedhereandhere). Multiple Snopes readers searched our website and emailed us to find out whether the meme was authentic.
On Sept. 6, Trump didshare a meme(archived) on his official Truth Social account with the caption, ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR."" That meme also depicted Trump as Kilgore from ""Apocalypse Now,"" as social media users claimed, but with the movie's name changed to ""Chipocalypse Now.""
(@realDonaldTrump on Truth Social)
The official White House account also shared a screenshot of the poston X(archived).
Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker condemned the poston X(archived), calling Trump a ""wannabe dictator."" He wrote:
The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city.
This is not a joke. This is not normal.
Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.
As Trump left the White House on Sept. 7, he downplayed the post and dismissed rumors about going to war with Chicago.
""We're not going to war. We're going to clean up our cities,"" Trumptold reporters(archived). ""We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war. That's common sense.""
During an appearance on CNN's State of the Unionthat same day, White House Border Czar Tom Homan also claimed Trump's words were ""taken out of context."" He told anchor Jake Tapper:
When I say we're going to war, we're going to war with the criminal cartels. We're going to war with illegal aliens, public safety threats that rape children, that raped citizens, that committed armed robberies, that distribute narcotics that kill Americans.
In sum, the claim that Trump shared a meme with the caption, ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,"" was true."
FBI Director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi spent nearly $1 million in overtime pay for personnel to redact the files related to the case of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.,True,"The FBI released files to Bloomberg investigative Reporter Jason Leopold following a civil lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. These files indicated that the agency had spent at least $851,344 the week of March 17, 2025, in overtime pay for 934 agents mobilized to process and redact the Epstein files as part of a project called Epstein Transparency Project 2025. Snopes verified the records were authentic using public documents the FBI filed in response to the lawsuit. The available documents neither confirmed nor disproved the related claims that the overtime pay was specifically for removing Trump's name from the files or that all of the money went to ""redaction training.""
In November 2025, a rumor circulated that FBI Director Kash Patel and the head of the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Pam Bondi, had spent nearly $1 million in overtime pay for FBI personnel to redact the files related to the case of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
A Nov. 28, 2025,post on Xsaid the FBI had ""quietly poured roughly $1M into overtime hours to scrub and redact the Epstein files,"" calling it ""treason"" (archived):
As of this writing, this post had amassed more than 72,000 likes and 2.2 million views.
Variations of the claim appeared elsewhere online. OneInstagram user said in a videothat Patel and Bondi spent $1 million to ""pull Trump's name out of the Epstein files,"" referring to President Donald Trump. Another version of the rumor appeared on X, where one usersaidthe FBI ""spent nearly $1 million for redaction training for the Epstein files,"" citingThe Daily Beast.
In short, FBI documents confirm the agency spent more than $850,000 on overtime pay for agents tasked with processing and redacting files related to the Epstein case. As a result, we've rated the claim true.
The available documents neither confirmed nor disproved the related claims that the overtime pay was specifically for removing Trump's name from the files or that all of the money went to ""redaction training.""
The claim came from areport(archived) by Jason Leopold, an investigative reporter at Bloomberg News. Leopold runs a newsletter named ""FOIA Files,"" in which he uses his expertise in obtaining and navigating government documents under theFreedom of Information Actto back his investigations. In his Nov. 25, 2025, edition of the newsletter, Leopold linked to a71-page PDFthat included a letter dated the previous day and that bore seal of the FBI in response to ""Civil Action No.: 25-cv-2848"" and regarding the ""Epstein Transparency Project 2025."" Leopold's address on the letter had been redacted.
These documents, which Leopold said the FBI released following a FOIA request and lawsuit he filed, indicated that the FBI paid$851,344 in overtime to processthe Epstein files—in other words, to scour and redact them, though the documents did not specify what information was being redacted. The records also showed 934 agents worked a total of 14,278 hours in ""premium pay"" (overtime) on the files. In his report, Leopold said that these numbers corresponded to the period between March 17 and March 22, 2025.
""The files I shared online are the complete files,"" Leopold told Snopes in a text message. ""They [the FBI] released this just to me in response to my lawsuit and emailed my attorney the records,"" he added, referring to the lawyer who represented him and Bloomberg in thelawsuitthey filed following his FOIA request.
While there was no evidence the FBI and its parent agency, the Department of Justice, had shared the documents publicly, Snopes confirmed that on Aug. 25, 2025, Leopold and Bloombergfiled a civil lawsuit against the FBI and the DOJto compel them to produce ""records regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation."" The lawsuit came after Leopold's FOIA request, filed in March 2025, went unanswered for five months.
On Nov. 24, 2025, DOJ lawyers filed documentation that included the letter they sent Leopold and a list of records the FBI released to Leopold and Bloomberg. That list matched the records Leopold published.
Among the documents pertaining to thelawsuit, Snopes found a Nov. 24, 2025,declarationby the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section Chief Amie Marie Napier. This declaration came the day before Leopold published his report.
Annexed to this declaration, the FBI shared Leopold's original FOIA request detailing the information he was seeking. Among the items he was looking to confirm were the number of FBI staff assigned to the task of processing the Epstein files during one week in March 2025, the cost of this effort, the number of hours they worked during that week and the instructions the staff received (Page 53 of the declaration):
3. A spreadsheet or similar data or document identifying the total number of FBI personnel who were ordered and/or tasked to work on processing Jeffrey Epstein files between March 17 and March 22. PLEASE NOTE: I am not interested in personal identifiable information. I am only interested in the number of FBI personnel who worked on this matter, their titles, and the field offices/divisions they work in.
4. The budget (if any such document exists) or a similar document identifying the total costs for FBI personnel to process Jeffrey Epstein files in response to any directive or order by FBI Director Kash Patel or his immediate aides and deputies.
5. The number of hours FBI personnel worked between March 17 through March 21 to process Jeffrey Epstein files. If the hours each agent worked are captured in a document I request a copy of that as well.
6. Any documented instruction or direction provided to FBI personnel on what type of research they were asked to conduct while processing Jeffrey Epstein files.
Thedeclaration'sappended documents also included the letter Leopold received and shared, which Napier signed (Page 96). In addition, the FBI provided a grid in which they itemized the documents they released to him, in full or in part (pages 103-106).
In this grid, Snopes identified the two items that revealed the number of extra hours, the number of agents who processed and redacted the Epstein files and the cost of their overtime. The ""report documenting premium pay hours recorded during the period of March 17 through March 22, 2025"" (Page 103) was released in part.
This corresponds to the table on pages 15 and 16 inLeopold's file, most of which was redacted, except for the total numbers at the bottom. This is the document that revealed the FBI mobilized 934 agents across departments and field offices to process the Epstein files that week. Together, they worked a total of 14,278 ""premium pay hours"" between March 17 and March 22, 2025, which cost taxpayers $851,344.
The FBI released the ""printout of overtime hours worked by RIDS units from January 20 2025 through July 29 2025"" (Page 104 of the declaration) in full, the grid showed. This corresponds to the table on Page 23 of Leopold's file. This document revealed that between January and July 2025,RIDS agents worked 4,737 hours in overtime, 3,472.25 of them in March, when the agency first processed the Epstein files.
Leopold's files did not detail what instructions, exactly, the agents received for processing the files, thoughPage 45referred to training videos posted on the ""Transparency Project SharePoint site"" on how to use the SharePoint site and how to redact using Adobe.
On March 24, 2025, an email from the Information Management Division of the FBI said that ""phase 1 redactions"" were complete ""and non-IMD project teams can be released."" (RIDS is part of the IMD.) That same email referred to a Phase 2 that had not yet begun.In other words, ""processing"" the Epstein files meant reviewing them for release by identifying in them details for redaction.An email exchange from March 10 (pages 11, 12 and 13 of Leopold's file) referred to a ""clean copy of the redaction list,""confirming that redaction was a goal of the project.
In addition to the above, agents had to review videos, according to both the declaration and Leopold's file.
While it is not clear that FBI agents ""scrubbed"" the files for Trump's name specifically or that the training alone had cost nearly $1 million, as some posts claimed, the documents showed that the FBI mobilized nearly 1,000 agents to redact information from the files and that this effort had cost the FBI and its parent agency, the DOJ, at least $851,344 during a period the FBI referred to in emails attached to the files as ""Phase 1"" of the Epstein Transparency Project 2025, suggesting Phase 2 was in the works."
A Somali politician in Maine placed a murder bounty on a journalist who reported on the politician's alleged Medicare fraud.,False,"The claim jumbled details from reports from political outlets in Maine that said relatives of Abdullahi Ali, a Somali politician and businessman in Maine, threatened a journalist whose employer repeated critical reporting about Ali. Snopes verified that the comments in question appeared to be threats but could not independently verify the commenters' reported relation to Ali.
In December 2025, a rumor circulated online that Abdullahi Ali, a Somali politician in Maine, had placed a murder bounty on a journalist who reported on allegations of Medicare fraud by Ali.
One X user who shared the claimwrote(archived):
BREAKING: A Somali politician in Maine has placed a BOUNTY on the head of a journalist for reporting fraud in Maine's Mainecare (medical). WTF is happening in America?! Time to KICK these LOWLIFE'S OUT.
Users onFacebook(archived) andInstagram(archived) also shared aTikTok video(archived) that made the claim.
Theallegedthreats(archived,archived) came from Abdi Najib Abdullahi and Ayanle Abdullahi Aden, reportedly relatives of Ali, rather than Ali himself, according toreportingby The Robinson Report, a Substack blog belonging to Steve Robinson, an investigative and political reporter in Maine.
Snopes consulted a Somali speaker whose translation of the comments revealed thatAdenappeared to offer ""50 camels"" to let a journalist's blood ""be spilled in the air"" andAbdullahisaid those in charge of Jubbaland Media would be ""held accountable immediately.""
Claims that Ali, whoran for presidency in the Somalian state of Jubbaland in itsdisputed2024 election but is not a political candidate in the U.S.,placed a bounty on a journalist himself were false.
It was unclear whether Aden and Abdullahi — who appeared to issue threats to a a journalist whose employer reported critically on Ali — were related to Ali, as the The Robinson Report claimed.
Snopes reached out to Ali, Aden and Abdullahi to confirm whether the three were related and the intent behind the comments and await replies to our queries.
According to translations provided to Snopes by a Somali speaker, Abdullahiposted(archived) a picture ofSabriye Somali,reportedlya journalist with Jubbaland Media, on Facebook on Dec. 5, 2025.
Abdullahi wrote, ""The young man who insulted the Jubbaland Media page is called Sabriye Somali. Brothers, I will say something later. They are so arrogant that they will not graze the trees.""
Abdullahi added in acomment, ""If Jubbaland Media is a place where officials are being insulted, we know the men who are in charge and will be held accountable immediately.""
Aden alsocommented, ""Let this one's blood be spilled in the air. 50 camels are enough for us to get this done.""
According to Abdi Iftin, an author and columnist who alsoreported(archived) on the alleged threats, Abdullahi was Ali's son and Aden his nephew, which was partly corroborated by a Facebookpost(archived) on Aden's profile.
Aden wrote that two men seen alongside him in the picture, one of whom was Abdullahi, were his cousins. If Abdullahi was Ali's son, that would make Aden Ali's nephew. Iftin told Snopes during a Dec. 9 phone call that he lived with Ali when he immigrated to the U.S. and knew Ali's family, which was how he identified the commenters.
The Robinson ReportclaimedAden was Ali's second cousin rather than nephew.
Snopes has not independently verified this claim.AbdullahiandAdenboth publicly criticized Iftin on their Facebook pages (archived,archived). Neither Ali nor Abdullahi's profiles confirmed that the pair were father and son.
Adbullahi's and Aden's posts and comments appeared to be in response to a Dec. 4, 2025, post on Jubbaland Media's Facebook pagethatrepeated(archived)allegationsby the Maine Wire,a news outlet run by the Maine Policy Institute, about alleged health care fraud by Ali. (The Maine Policy Institutecalls itself nonpartisanbut also describes itself as having a""center-right"" reputation; other local news outlets havecalled it conservative.)
According to theMaine Wire,Ali's company Gateway Community Services received $28.9 million from the U.S. government between 2019 and 2024. The report claimed Ali had spent some of that U.S. taxpayer money to fund a paramilitary group in his homeland of Somalia and build a political campaign there.
We could not independently verify claims made by the Maine Wire and The Robinson Report about how much money Ali received from or owed to MaineCare, nor whether he used taxpayer money to fund paramilitary forces in Somalia or his political campaign there.
The Maine Wirereportedthat Ali's Gateway Community Services owed MaineCare almost $800,000 from a state audit.
According to documents the outlet said it obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request, Maine officials audited Gateway Community Services in 2022 and found that more than one in three payments made to the company in 2017 and 2018 was made in error due to incorrect or lacking documentation. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services reportedly found it had overpaid Gateway Community Services $776,022.21, which the company would need to pay back.
Accordingto The Robinson Report, Ali and Gateway Community Services had not cleared that debt by August 2025.
We reached out to the Maine health department to verify the documents The Robinson Report and the Maine Wire shared and await a reply.
Writing onFacebook(archived), Ali called the Maine Wire ""a racist and hateful group."" He did not respond to allegations about his debt to the Maine DHHS or that he spent U.S. taxpayer money building a political campaign in Somalia, instead writing:
I am proud to have built a great business in Maine, served my community in Maine, earned my PhD in Maine, and now I am running for office in Jubaland. I am proud of that. I am honored to be able to support my people in Jubaland with my salary."
“Guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina.”,True,"North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein faced pushback on social media over a claim about his state’s gun violence.

""Guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina,"" Stein said in a June 6poston the social media platform X.

The claim is relevant to current political debates. State lawmakers recently voted to override Stein’s veto of House Bill 193, allowing private school teachers and others to bring guns on campus. Republican legislators hope to also override Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 50, which would allow people as young as 18 to carry concealed handguns without training or a background check.

Stein talked about guns being the leading cause of children’s deaths just before the state House voted on the repeal of concealed carry rules that also lowers the age limit to have handguns from 21 to 18. Social media users questioned whether Stein’s post was accurate, and some asked for data to back his claim.

Our review of research shows Stein’s claim has merit, with one caveat: For the bulk of children — those ages 1 to 17 — guns are the top, fatal culprit. When infants under 1 are included in the tally, prenatal conditions become the leading cause of death.

""More than 1,400 North Carolina children died in 2023, the most recent data available from the state, including 102 who died from gunshot wounds. That’s less than the number of infants who died from childbirth complications, which was 448. But among children 1-17, no other cause claimed more than 100 lives.""

Stein’s communications team cited a February 2025reportby theNorth Carolina Child Fatality Task Force, which cataloged data from 2023.

The task force, created in 1991, examines information surrounding the deaths of children up to age 17. Thegroupincludes members appointed by the Democratic governor and Republican legislative leaders. Many of its members work in fields related to health care, law enforcement or social services. We also examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which researches causes of death.

For North Carolina children ages 1 through 17,CDC datafor 2023 show that firearm-related injuries were the leading cause of death. In North Carolina, the CDC logged 100 deaths related to firearms — just ahead of motor vehicle accidents, which caused 96 deaths. Firearm-related deaths were also the leading cause of fatalities for the 1-though-17 age group in 2022, according to ananalysis of CDC databy researchers at Johns Hopkins University.

The state task force’s report lays out a couple of ways of measuring death data.

In its executive summary, the task force lists ""injuries"" as the top cause of death for children ages 1 through 17. Under the injury category, motor accidents killed the most people: 99. Homicide caused 78 deaths and suicide was the cause of 59.

The report goes on to say, though, that the number of deaths caused by guns — either by homicide or suicide — surpasses the number of deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents.

Of the combined 137 homicides and suicides in 2023, 102 were committed with a firearm. That number is down from 2022, when there were 108 gun-related child fatalities, but up from totals reported from 2014 to 2019, according to the task force report.

In the six years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, gun-related child fatalities ranged from 38 to 62 per year. Gun-related child fatalities then surged to 109 in 2020 and to 121 in 2021. That’s why Stein’sproposed state budget, released in March, requested more than $2.3 million to promote safe gun storage, his office said.

The GOP-controlled General Assembly hasn’t taken up Stein’s proposed budget and is unlikely to do so.

When infants are included in the data, the top cause of death changes.

For all children — from birth through age 17 — the top cause of death in North Carolina was perinatal conditions, according to both state and federal data. The state’s task force documented 448 deaths related to childbirth — conditions such as low birthweight and birth defects. The CDC reported 446 deaths related to childbirth in North Carolina in 2023, a higher toll than any other cause of death.

However, researchers havetold PolitiFactthat they often exclude infants when analyzing ""child"" fatalities because infants can suffer from conditions that are unique to children who are younger than 12 months.

""Infant mortality has distinct leading causes, such as congenital conditions and perinatal complications, which differ significantly from the causes of death among older children and adolescents, including firearm injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and cancer,"" Cassandra Crifasi, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact in an email.

""By excluding infants and focusing on children ages 1–17, researchers can better identify and compare the leading external causes of death relevant to injury prevention and public health strategies for this age group,"" Crifasi said.

In a news release issued the same day of Stein’s social media post, the governor differentiated gun deaths from fatalities suffered by infants. He said firearms are the leading cause of ""injury-related death"" for children in the state.

Stein said ""guns are the leading cause of death for children in North Carolina.""

State and CDC data support Stein’s claim for children ages 1 through 17. When infants are considered, perinatal conditions become the top cause of death for all children under 18 years old. But researchers often exclude infants from datasets on child fatalities because infants suffer from conditions that other children don’t.

The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True."
"Says President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social, “I am ending dual citizenship under the Espionage Act and all these traitors will be ‘denaturalized and deported.’”",False,"U.S. law allows Americans to hold citizenship in other countries, ""whether by birth, descent, naturalization or other form of acquisition,"" the State Department’swebsitesays.

But an image of a purported Truth Social post from President Donald Trump might leave some social media users wondering whether that right is threatened.

""Starting on Monday, I am ending dual citizenship under the Espionage Act and all these traitors will be ‘denaturalized and deported’ to the country they came from,"" reads what looks like a March 30 Truth Social post from Trump. ""No exceptions!!!!! America is for Americans, not all these foreigners who hate our great country and don’t even pay taxes.""

"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a video featuring Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids alongside footage of the TV show ""Pokémon"" and its theme song, often referred to as “Gotta Catch ‘em All.”",True,"Rumors that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted a video using imagery and music from the popular media franchise ""Pokémon,"" co-owned by video game publisher Nintendo and game developer GameFreak, circulated online in late September 2025.
According to claims circulating on social media websites such asX(archived),Facebook(archived), andReddit, the video featured footage of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids alongside clips from the ""Pokémon"" TV show intro segment and its theme song, colloquially referred to by the franchise's catchphrase, ""Gotta Catch 'em All.""
One user on Reddit commented, ""I wanna see the Trump administration go up against Nintendo's legal department,"" suggesting the use of ""Pokémon"" was unsanctioned.
""Pokémon"" is a franchise about collecting and training creatures to do battle against one another and has been the subject of a wide range of video games, films, television shows, trading card games, and more.
The rumor that DHS posted a video to its social media accounts featuring footage of ICE raids spliced with ""Pokémon"" imagery and music is true.
DHS posted the video to itsX account(archived) andFacebookpage (archived) on Sept. 22, 2025. The same video was featured on the Stories section of its officialInstagram account.
Reached for comment and asked whether DHS received permission from Nintendo for using the ""Pokémon"" intellectual property (IP), a DHS spokesperson told Snopes via email, ""To arrest them is our real test. To deport them is our cause.""
The comment was a reference to the ""Pokémon"" theme song. The video featured the first verse and chorus of the song, the lyrics of which are:
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside
(Pokémon)
(Gotta catch 'em all) It's you and me
I know it's my destiny (Pokémon)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend (Pokémon)
(Gotta catch 'em all) A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you (Ooh, ooh)
Pokémon! (Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all
In addition, the video in question also featured mock-up images of the alleged ""worst of the worst"" people whom ICE had arrested as ""Pokémon"" cards, a popular trading card game based on Nintendo's hit franchise. The DHS Facebook page also made aseparate post(archived) featuring these images.
The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), which represents the shared ownership of the media franchise between Nintendo and GameFreak, lists ""diversity and inclusion"" as a ""core value"" on itsofficial website, saying, ""TPCi believes in a just and equitable world and that every person, employee, and fan has the unique skills, powers, and purpose to contribute to this common cause.""
Further, TPCi's website states, ""We hope to help make the world a better place for everyone by creating opportunities to bond and grow through shared journeys and friendly competition.""
Given that the Trump administration has been staunchly in opposition todiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, it seemed unlikely that Nintendo, GameFreak or TPCi gave DHS permission to use the IP in such a manner.
A spokesperson for TPCi told Snopes via email, ""We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."""
"TikTok videos show police clearing out homeless encampments in Washington, D.C.",False,"As part of President Donald Trump’s Washington, D.C., takeover, law enforcement agents are clearing out homeless encampments.Newsorganizationsand residents captured videos of officers pasting eviction notices on tents and usingtrash trucksto discard people’s belongings.

But some social media users seized on these real events to generate fake videos using artificial intelligence.

""Police moved in today to clear out a homeless camp in the city,"" a narrator said in an Aug. 16 TikTokvideoas sirens blare in the background.

""City crews tore down tents and packed up belongings and swept the park clean,"" another narrator said as the video continued. ""Some protested. Some begged for more time. But the clean up went on. What was once a community is now just an empty field.""

The post showed what appears to be footage of police gathering around tents, men in yellow vests sweeping trash bags and putting tents in a truck and a crowd of people protesting.

Another Aug. 19 TikTokvideoshowed a long tree-lined path littered with trash and tents and an official-looking building, possibly the White House or a monument, in the background. It appears to show hundreds of people including some in yellow vests cleaning the trash.

""An encampment for the unhoused in Washington D.C. was cleared by employees of the city's Department of Health and Human Services,"" the video’s caption read. ""The residents of the homeless encampment packed up their belongings and left with the help of city outreach workers, as well as non-profit employees and volunteers.""

But neither video is real. They were both generated with artificial intelligence. Here’s how to tell.

Some AI-generated content includes watermarks or disclaimers.

For example, the clips in the Aug. 16 TikTok post included a small watermark that read ""Veo"" on the bottom-right corner. Veo is Google’s AI video generator. Theplatformlets users create eight-second videos, which helps explain why the clips in the TikTok post are all shorter than that.

The Aug. 19 TikTok video didn’t have a visible watermark. However, the post included a tag that said ""creator labeled as AI-generated."" TikTok’sguidelines""require creators to label all AI-generated content that contains realistic images, audio, and video.""

Despite how realistic AI-generated videos can be, they’re not perfect, and looking closely at the clips can frequently revealvisual inconsistencies.

At the two-second mark in the Aug. 16 video, a woman holding a white trash bag appeared from behind police officers. In the same moment, a blur of another person walked through her before disappearing. After that, about six seconds into the video, a police officer took one of the woman’s trash bags as the other bag she was holding vanished.

In another clip, a man in a yellow vest folded up a tent. As he turned toward the camera, a pole seemed to pass through his body, and the tent he was folding disappeared.

Video of protesters showed people holding signs with illegible messaging and a woman whose hand looked blurry, with what looked like more than five fingers. The clip included captions with misspelled words and blurry letters.



(Screengrab from TikTok)

The Aug. 19 video also had inconsistencies. For example, a man in a yellow vest set down what looked like a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag morphed into a white plastic bag. Eventually, a person appeared from that bag.

Additionally, the trees lining the path in the video had no leaves. Trump’s Washington, D.C. takeover started Aug. 11, in the middle of summer, when trees in the district have green leaves.

It’s unclear which government building is supposed to be represented in the background of the video. The White House, the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson memorial all have white columns similar to the ones in the video. But, in real life, none of those buildings has a dirt road lined by trees leading up to them.

“Promises kept: negative net migration (in the U.S.) for the first time in 50 years!”,False,"President Donald Trump said he has fulfilled one of his campaign promises: More people are leaving the country than immigrating to it, he said.

""Promises made. Promises kept. Negative net migration for the first time in 50 years!"" Trump said in a Truth SocialpostAug. 4.

OtherWhite Houseofficialstouted it as a historic development.

""During the last period in which America was the undisputed global superpower — finically, culturally, militarily — immigration was net negative,"" Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said in an Aug. 3X post. ""All population growth was from family formation.""

The statements followed an Aug. 3segmentby CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten, who said, ""2025 net migration in the U.S. down at least 60% from last year. In fact, we may be heading for the first time in at least 50 years in which we have net negative migration into the United States."" Miller included the CNN clip in his X post, and the White House also shared it in anews release.

What ""may be"" is a prediction. That’s different from what is. We checked the data.

The available numbers are 2025 projections, not final numbers. One think tank predicts there will be negative net migration to the U.S. this year. Others estimate that although net migration will be lower than in years past, it will not be negative.

Negative net migration is possible in 2025, but Trump ""has no basis to make that claim until the US Census Bureau analyzes the 2025 data next year,"" Michael Clemens, George Mason University economics professor, said.

According to the Census Bureaucalendar, net migration data will be published in December 2025.

When PolitiFact asked the White House for evidence net migration is in the negative, a spokesperson shared Enten’s CNN clip.

""President Trump was elected on his promise to end illegal immigration, deport criminal illegal aliens, and put Americans First — that’s exactly what he’s doing,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

The White House did not respond to our questions about what period Miller was referring to as the one in which the immigration was ""net negative.""

Net migrationmeasureshow many people immigrated to the U.S. minus the number of people who moved out of the county. If it’s positive, more people entered than left. This number is used to determine how many people live in the U.S., how old they are and how many can participate in the labor force, for example.

""As the U.S. population ages and more U.S.-born residents enter retirement, immigration will become increasingly important for driving labor force growth,"" the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said in an Octoberreport.

Historically, the country’s population has grown as births exceeded deaths, according to a December 2024 U.S. Census Bureaureport. But in recent years, with fewer births and more deaths, the U.S. has relied on net migration for population growth.

Determining net migration relies on data about how many people immigrated to the U.S., including people who entered illegally and were released into the U.S. to seek asylum, people who evaded border officials and people who entered legally on visas or through the refugee program. The number also accounts for people who left the country voluntarily and through deportation.

The 2025 net migration is ""contingent on the administration’s progress toward its deportation goal,"" Clemens said. And it will ""not be independently verifiable until the Census Bureau conducts independent analysis late next year.""

RELATED:How much power does Donald Trump have to change the census and who is counted in it?

Net immigration data from before 2000 is limited. However, from 1971 to 1980, around 50 years ago, net migration was positive, according to theCongressional Research Service.

The U.S. experienced negative net migration more than 85 years ago, in the period from 1931 to 1940. The U.S. was in the midst of theGreat Depressionduring most of those years. In response to high unemployment rates, the U.S. government carried out anefforttoexpelmillions ofMexicans, including thoseborn in the U.S.

A January 2022studypublished in the Journal of Public Economics found the repatriations ""resulted in reduced employment"" and U.S. born workers taking lower skilled jobs.

A 2024 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Real Estatestudyfound that expelling Mexicans from the U.S. during that period ""negatively impacted U.S. cities"" by lowering house values and slowing real estate growth.

Clemens said these examples show that ""net negative immigration is a story of shame and loss from around 90 years ago, not a story of triumph from 50 years ago.""

Of the five groups that published 2025 net migration estimates, all agree that U.S. net migration will decrease.

In July, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank,saidnet migration will likely fall between a loss of 525,000 people to a gain of 115,000 people. The report was co-authored by two economists from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.

""Though small positive net flows are within our projected range and certainly possible, we believe zero or net negative migration for the year is more likely,"" the group’s report said.

Among its reasons for the predicted ""dramatic decrease"" is one simple one: The number of people immigrating to the U.S. has and will continue to drop. Illegal immigration at the U.S. southern border hasdropped sharplyduring the Trump administration. Trump has alsocurtailedseveralprogramsthat allow people to enter the U.S. legally, such as the refugee program which he hasindefinitely paused.

The American Enterprise Institute also predicted that fewer work and student visas will be issued this year due toadditional vettingandtravel bans.

The number of people moving out of the U.S. is also likely to increase, the group said. Massdeportationsand people choosing to voluntarily leave in a ""generalized fear and anti-immigrant climate"" play a role.

Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the institute and one of the report’s authors, said it may be impossible to know with certainty whether there will be negative net migration in 2025, particularly ""if the number is close to zero, as it may well be."" He said it’s especially difficult to track people who voluntarily leave the U.S.

In July, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Franciscoestimateda 2025 net migration of about 1 million people. The number is a drop from the 2.8 million net immigration growth in 2024, the Census Bureaureported.

""The number of immigrants entering the United States began to decline in the second half of 2024 and fell sharply in the first half of 2025,"" the reserve bank’s report said.

In a June podcast, Sam Coffin, a senior economist at the investment banking company Morgan Stanley,estimateda net population growth of 300,000 people in 2025. That same month, Oxford Economics, a global advisory firm,projecteda net migration of 500,000 in 2025.

Despite having different projections, the groups noted that reduced or negative net migration could negatively affect the economy. Among them:

The American Enterprise Institute predicted it could slow labor force growth and decrease the country’s gross domestic product — the sum of all goods and services produced within a nation's borders.

Oxford Economics cited lower GDP and increased inflation resulting from a smaller labor force that is unlikely to be filled by U.S.-born workers.

Some of the analyses noted that the effects may be limited, one group said high net migration in previous years will help offset some of these effects.

Trump said, ""Promises kept: negative net migration for the first time in 50 years.""

What Trump presented as a statement of fact is actually a predictive summary of a more cautious CNN clip.

Multiple projections say 2025 net migration is likely to show a notable decline. But there are no current numbers showing the U.S. has reached negative net migration in 2025, as Trump’s statement reads.

Among five published estimates, one projected that the U.S. will have 2025 negative net migration and four predicted net migration will decline but remain positive.

The Census Bureau will publish net migration estimates in December 2025.

The last time the U.S. had negative net migration was at least 85 years ago, during the Great Depression.

The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False."
"""The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.""",True,"One of many things Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said during his record-breaking, 25-hour-plus Senate floor speech: consumers are losing confidence in the U.S. economy.

BookersaidApril 1, ""The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down. If you ask the question, are you better off than you were 71 days ago, not many Americans would say … that they’re better off. Their costs are higher. Their groceries are higher. They’re soon to see everything from car prices to food go higher.""

Measures of consumer confidence have historically carried weight both on private-sector business investment decisions and policymaking by elected officials.

On April 2, after Booker’s speech, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs that could affect future consumer confidence levels. For now, though, the latest data available is from February and March.

The two main consumer confidence surveys — the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index — support Booker’s statement. Booker’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that those surveys were what the senator referenced.

To some extent, ""way down"" is in the eye of the beholder. But compared to recent presidents at the start of their terms, the drop under Trump is unusually large.

""It's a serious fall,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.

The Conference Board, a business research group, has produced its Consumer Confidence Index for decades. It gauges consumers’ feelings about topics such as current and future labor market conditions, current and future business conditions and future income expectations.

In November 2024, the month Trump was reelected, the index stood at 111.7. Since then, it has fallen every month, with the March measurement at 92.9, a 17% decline since November.

The last time the index was below 92.9 was in the first month of Joe Biden’s presidency, January 2021, when it was 87.1. That was during the coronavirus pandemic, and beginning with February 2021, the metric never fell below 92.9 for the remainder of Biden’s term.

A related Conference Board metric known as the Expectations Index — which is based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions — dropped in March to its lowest level in 12 years and below the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead, the groupsaidin its news release on the monthly numbers.

How does Trump compare with his recent White House predecessors?

Since 2001, two presidents (Trump in his first term, and Biden) saw the Conference Board index rise during the same timeframe we tracked for Trump’s current term — from the November before they took office to March of their first term.

Two other presidents saw it fall: George W. Bush, by 9%, and Obama, by 30%. Obama took office in 2009 during the Great Recession, at a historic low point for the index, meaning a modest drop in points produced a large percentage decline.

TheUniversity of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which has also been tabulated for decades, rose from November to December 2024, then fell in January and February. From December 2024 to February, it declined nearly 13%. February’s level was lower than at any point in 2024.

""The decrease was unanimous across groups by age, income, and wealth,"" survey director Joanne Hsuwrotein the statistical release.

This decline was the largest among presidents since 2001.

Since 2001, three presidents (Obama, Trump in his first term and Biden) saw the University of Michigan index rise during the same timeframe we tracked for Trump’s current term — from the November before they took office to February of their first term.

The only president in that timeframe to see a decline in the index, Bush, saw a 15% reduction, which was smaller than Trump’s reduction in his current term. For Bush, this period came during the lead-up to a recession, whichofficially beganin March 2001.

Booker said, ""The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.""

This aligns with the two major consumer confidence surveys. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index has fallen by 17% since November 2024, while the University of Michigan Consider Sentiment Index has fallen nearly 13% since December 2024.

With one exception, for Obama during the Great Recession, these declines are greater than for any president since 2001 during similar timeframes in their presidencies.

The removed study's findings line up with other research into the subject. Areport from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, found that excluding 9/11, the majority of murders in politically motivated terrorist acts in the U.S. since 1975 have been by people with right-wing ideologies. Even when including the 9/11 attacks, which skews the data heavily toward Islamic extremism being the most common ideology of politically motivated terrorist attacks, right-wing ideologies were still far more common than left-wing ideologies in perpetrators of politically motivated terrorist acts.
AUniversity of Maryland Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice studysimilarly found it was nearly twice as likely for a violent act of extremism in the U.S. to be committed by a right-wing extremist than by a left-wing extremist."
"Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk once said that if he had a 10-year-old daughter who became pregnant after being raped, he would want her to deliver the baby.",True,"The question was a hypothetical, although Kirk did have an infant daughter at the time.
Afterconservative pundit Charlie Kirk was fatally shotSept. 10, 2025, during an event at Utah Valley University, social media users sharing numerous posts containing statements Kirk had supposedly made.
One such claim,sharedonmultipleplatforms, was that Kirk once said that if he had 10-year-old daughter who became pregnant after being raped, he would want her to deliver the baby. Snopes readers searched the site looking for more information about the purported statement.
A post shared by Feminist News (@feminist_news_now)
We found the statement was real. It came from a 2024 YouTube video published by Jubilee titled ""Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?""
The video was the first in a series called ""Surrounded,"" where one person must defend and debate their beliefs to a group of 20-plus people who hold opposing beliefs. (Critics have said the formatprioritizes sound bites over logical argumentsand that itprovides a platformfor extremists).
Kirk defended four claims in the video, the first of which was ""Abortion is murder and should be illegal."" The group surrounding Kirk was given 20 minutes to debate him on the topic.
With three minutes remaining, a woman identified as Marenhad the following exchange with Kirk. The transcript has been edited for clarity because both Kirk and Maren talked over each other at points:
MAREN: So I just have one question, there's — in any case, you don't think there's any case where abortion should be legal?
KIRK: There is a very, very rare couple cases —
MAREN: OK, so you do think there are a couple cases it is legal?
KIRK: If cesarean section is not going to save the mother's life, and the mother's life is actually at risk, which is debated amongst growing numbers of OB-GYNs, that is the only case where abortion should be allowed. But, it is a growing consensus in the pro-life world that abortion is never medically necessary.
MAREN: OK. So if you had a daughter and she was 10 and she got raped, and —
KIRK: Well, I do have a daughter.
MAREN: Wait, and she was going to give birth and she was going to live, would you want her to go through that and carry her rapist's baby?
KIRK: Well, that's awfully graphic.
MAREN: No, but it's a real-life scenario that happens to many people.
KIRK: Calm down, the answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.
MAREN: Oh, OK great, that's insane.
KIRK: But let me tell you why. No, hold on, let me ask you a question. There's two ultrasounds — one is a baby conceived in rape, one is a baby conceived by a loving couple. Which one is which? [points around the room]
MAREN: Your daughter was hopefully conceived by a somewhat loving couple.
KIRK: Which person here was conceived by rape? Tell me which one was conceived by rape?
MAREN: You don't know.
KIRK: Exactly, it's all human rights and it's all human beings.
MAREN: But that doesn't matter, but it's about your daughter who has to give birth to it and is gonna be tortured by that for the rest of her life. That's gonna take away every freedom she's ever gonna have, that's gonna ruin her life, she's gonna grow up and she's gonna be attached to another thing.
KIRK: Abortion is not a victimless crime. The point is, how you were conceived is irrelevant to what human rights you get. If a person conceived in rape walks down the side of the street, it's not like they don't get First Amendment rights or Second Amendment rights.
MAREN: It's not about that person —
KIRK: The worst thing to do to that daughter is to then say, ""Hey, we're going to go murder the being inside of you.""
MAREN: They wouldn't even know — like, listen.
KIRK: They wouldn't know?
MAREN: Listen, listen, listen.
KIRK: But wouldn't it be a better story to say something evil happened and we do something good in the face of evil instead of saying we're going to do evil and then murder the being because we're gonna pander to the evil? No. What makes the West great is that we do good after evil, not evil after evil."

The post included a photograph of Cobb and read, in part:
[Trump] is worse than anyone in our history in my experience and opinion. As people seem to have forgotten, I was very critical of Biden and despite knowing him and his family well, I spent 4 years writing about his cognitive decline and weak foreign policy. He had competent advisors though including very decent men as AG and head of the FBI. While you could fairly question their effectiveness you couldn't doubt their character. Trump has real contempt for the country, appoints wholly unqualified people to key positions and just kicked 12 million people off Medicaid, eliminated child food support and killed worldwide healthcare efforts monitoring pandemic producing diseases including Ebola (among countless other dangerous things).

"U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, ""Children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism.""",True,"During an Oct. 9, 2025, Cabinet meeting, Kennedy said, ""There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism and it's highly likely because they're given Tylenol."" Researchers have heavily criticized studies on the supposed link, which are from 2013 and 2015.
In October 2025, after a meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump's Cabinet, aclaim(archived) circulated online that Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism.
Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that doesn't have a single known cause. Researchers currently believe autism develops from acombinationof genetics and environmental factors.
Following Trump's Oct. 9 Cabinet meeting, social media users shared Kennedy's alleged quote about a supposed link between autism and early circumcision. One Facebookposton the topic read, ""BREAKING: RFK Jr.: 'Children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism.'""
Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin from the penis and is usually performed in the first few days after a child is born. Children get circumcised for medical, religious and cultural reasons as well as for personal preference.Accordingto the American Academy of Pediatrics, the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks of the procedure.
The claim also circulatedon X(archived),Instagram(archived),Threads(archived),Bluesky(archived) andReddit(archived).
The White House's official livestream of the meeting on YouTube showed that during the Oct. 9 Cabinet meeting, Kennedysaid, ""There's two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism and it's highly likely because they're given Tylenol."" He continued, ""So, you know, none of this is positive but all of it is stuff that we should be paying attention to."" Kennedy himselfconfirmed(archived) this quote on his X account. Therefore, we find the statement to be correctly attributed.
Kennedy said on his X profile that his Oct. 9 statement referred to a researchpapertitled ""Evidence That Acetaminophen Triggers Autism in Susceptible Individuals Has Been Ignored and Mishandled for More than a Decade."" The paper's authors published it onPreprint.org, a site that hosts research papers before they are peer-reviewed or published online by journals.
That study reviewed research papers on PubMed about autism and acetaminophen (best known by the brand name Tylenol) or paracetamol (another name for acetaminophen) and the link between them. It found that the scientific community had ""mishandled"" earlier studies in the field through ""misinterpretation"" of data. ""Irrational criticisms"" of papers in the field also played a role in their mishandling, according to the study.
The study concluded: ""Available evidence is already more than sufficient to establish a causal relationship between acetaminophen and autism, and resolution of the problem need not wait on additional studies.""
One of the studies the preprint paper cited as ""some of the most compelling 'standalone' evidence that acetaminophen is a developmental neurotoxin"" was a 2015 peer-reviewedstudythat compared circumcised and noncircumcised boys from Denmark up to 9 years old. That study found that circumcised boys up to 4 years old were twice as likely to develop infantile autism as their uncircumcised peers.
The preprint study also referenced a 2013 peer-reviewedstudythat suggested that a rise in circumcision rates ""was associated"" with a rise in autism spectrum disorder diagnoses across the nine countries it studied. It also suggested that autism prevalence in those countries rose after more doctors started using acetaminophen in circumcisions in 1995.
Both the 2013 and 2015 studies faced variouscriticisms.Criticsof the 2015 study noted its small sample size (according to the study, 57 autism spectrum cases in ""ritually circumcised"" boys and 4,929 cases in intact boys) and that the study only found a significant increased risk of autism in boys 4 and younger.
The 2013 study faced similar criticism for its nine-country sample size. Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston Universityprofessor emerituswho sits on theexecutive boardof the Coalition of Autism Scientists — a group that advocates for high-quality research into the condition —toldScientific American that the 2013 study failed to consider any factors besides acetaminophen use to account for a rise in autism prevalence.
Genetic factors and the age of a child's parents can affectautism ratesas well as methods and resources for diagnosis.
Both studies said their findings established correlation rather than causation, meaning that the 2013 study did not claim that higher rates of acetaminophenuse in children caused autism diagnoses to rise, nor did the 2015 study claim that circumcisions caused autism diagnoses in children who had the procedure. Both studies also said larger-scale research was needed, something the preprint study claimed was unnecessary.
Morten Frisch, one of the 2015 study's authors, alsoco-submitteda citizen's initiative to raise the legal minimum age for circumcisions of otherwise healthy children to 18. Danish politiciansdid not passthe resulting bill. Frisch declared a competing interest in the 2015 study. William Parker, a co-author on thepreprintstudy Kennedy cited, has published multiple articles on the suspected link between autism and acetaminophen. Parker wasreportedlyin frequent communication with Kennedy and other health officials in the U.S., according to a September 2025 interview in The Atlantic.
Trump hastasked Kennedywith investigation the rise in national autism rates. In the Oct. 9 Cabinet meeting, Trump and Kennedy both repeated a largelyunsupportedtheory that taking Tylenol during pregnancy could increase a child's risk of being diagnosed with autism.
Snopes has reportedextensivelyon Tylenol's suspected link to autism after Trump began repeating the unsupported claim."
"Iceland installed foldable, solar-powered shelter pods between alleyways for homeless people, as described in a November 2025 Facebook post.",False,"In November 2025, a rumor about a project to help homeless people in Iceland spread overFacebook(archived), getting tens of thousands of likes and shares within a couple of days.
According to the post that was the source of the rumor, cities in Iceland were installing ""micro-housing hubs"" for homeless people in urban alleyways, utilizing foldable, solar-powered pods with heated mattress strips to do so.
The post was shared elsewhere on social media, including by otherFacebook accounts(archived) and toInstagram(archived). A Snopes reader reached out to us by email to ask about the truth of the rumor.
The story about Iceland's foldable, solar-powered pods for homeless people was false, although similar concepts have been tested at a small scale elsewhere.
AGoogle searchfor ""Iceland homeless pods"" revealed no evidence such a project was real. The only links referring to the pods were social media posts spreading the claim.
The description of the Icelandic pods is similar to that of made-up German homeless pods shared previously byFact 27(archived) and otherFacebook(archived)pages(archived) that share fabricated stories of feel-good scientific innovations and advancements.
These claims, whether set in Iceland or Germany, have roots in projects to design and distribute real pods meant to help people who are homeless, even if the social media posts falsely exaggerate their functionality and usage.
In 2020, the city of Ulm, Germany,debutedwhat it called theUlmer Nest, which were sleeping pods designed to serve as emergency shelters for homeless people on cold winter nights. The Ulmer Nests were solar-powered and included similar features to the fake pods in the social media posts, such as sensors to let social workers know when one of the pods were in use. However, theUlmer Nest websitesays only two hand-assembled prototypes exist and there aren't yet plans to mass produce them as the current prototypes are still in the evaluation phase. TheUlmer Nest Facebook pagehasn't been updated since 2021 and the current status of the project is unknown.
A British charity called Amazing Grace Spaces also has a similar concept with itsemergency urban sleeper pods. These pods, which theBBC reportedwere in use in the British community of West Bowling in April 2025, include a bed, toilet and USB socket.
Iceland, for its part, has a small homeless population. According to national data published by theOECD, a collection of much of the Earth's wealthy countries, there are 1,272 homeless people in Iceland, which is 0.34% of the population. However, only 194 of those people are literally living on the streets.
Iceland does not have a national strategy for tackling homelessness, but Reykjavik, the country's capital andhome to over half of its people,does. This includes work to put 20tiny housesinto operation around the city, which can be transported to different places if necessary. These tiny houses are big enough to have a living room, sleeping nook, kitchenette and bathroom, and are thus larger than the ""pods""described in the Facebook post.

A mural symbolizing North and South America working together was painted on the Mexican side of the U.S-Mexico border wall in Tijuana.,True,"In August 2025, the Trump administration announced it wouldpaint the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border blackin the hopes the wall would become hotter and thus deter people from climbing it.
In the days following that announcement, people on social media began posting photos of the Mexican side of the wall, such as thisInstagram post(archived), claiming that the people on that side painted a mural on the wall instead. That same mural, an eagle and condor over a green background, was shared in anotherInstagram post(archived) and onFacebook. According to those posts, the eagle and condor symbolize North and South America.
Other popular posts onX(archived),Threads(archived) andFacebook(archived) used photos of an earlier blue mural painted over the wall and claimed that it was in response to the Trump administration painting the other side black.
A mural was indeed painted on the Mexican side of the border wall in Tijuana, Mexico, in the summer of 2025. The mural, titled, ""Abrazo Mutuo,"" was painted before the Trump administration announced it'd be painting the American side of the wall black.
Mexican artistLibre Gutierrezpainted the mural forFriendship Park, a binational park that sits on either side of the border between San Diego, California, and Tijuana.
BothFriendshipParkandGutierrezposted clips to their Instagram accounts of Gutierrez working on the mural throughout July 2025. Friendship Park held anopening ceremonyfor the mural on July 19. On July 30, Gutierrez posted aphoto of the full muralwith an explanation of its symbolism in Spanish. According to Instagram's translation:
""MUTUAL EMBRACE"", monumental mural where we interpret the Latin American prophecy of the Eagle and the Condor (over 2000 years), where it tells us that when they are in shared flight there will be peace and harmony on earth - representing the wisdom and knowledge of both hemispheres - the Condor symbolizing the people of the South and the Royal Eagle the peoples of the North. With a backdrop of a Baja California landscape and native plants of the region throughout the composition, which comes with the great work of the Friendship Park - activity promoted by Dan Watman and his team tirelessly - this year marks its 54th anniversary, themes fitting for the moment where we want to contrast any hate speech of the neighbor with Education, Elegance and Culture, our Mexican and Latin American culture.
Although this mural was only recently painted at the time of the social media posts, the Mexican side of the border at Friendship Park has long played host for art.Google Maps Street Viewscreenshots from October 2021 showed an older wall at the locationpainted with various murals. Photos of the wall painted with different artistic pieces were onFriendship Park's website. TheSan Diego-based Museum of Uspreserved sections of the border wall due to their artistic and cultural value when those sections were being replaced by the federal government in spring 2024.
The blue mural included in some of the social posts was painted on the previous version of the wall at Friendship Park, according to a2019 story from Quadratin, a Mexican news site. That mural could be seen on Google Street View inJune 2017,October 2017andJune 2019."
Men “have the lowest college attainment rate ever.”,True,"Arizona Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego said his political party needs to work harder to appeal to men, given how male votershelped propelPresident Donald Trump to his 2024 victory.

""A lot of Democrats don’t even try talking to men,"" Gallego said on the March 24 ""Raging Moderates""podcastepisode. ""We don’t talk about the fact that they have the lowest college attainment rate ever, that they are living at home with their parents, they are not having success.""

Data shows Gallego — whostood outamong 2024’s campaigning Democrats in part because he madeappealing to mena central part of his messaging — is largely accurate on male college attainment levels.

Education experts use the term ""college attainment"" to describe different things — in some cases, it refers to college completion rates; in others, it refers to any college experience. Gallego didn’t specify in the podcast what he was describing, but his spokesperson told us later he was referring to the share of male population on campus. Gallego’s overall point that men are attending postsecondary educational institutions at lower rates than womenhas beenwidelyreportedby think tanks and news outlets.

According to theNational Center for Education Statistics, four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low. This shift is a reversal of historical norms. The first U.S. woman to obtain a degree, Catherine Benson,graduated in 1840. Before then, higher education in the United States was reserved exclusively for men. Women have comprised more than 50% of college enrollmentsince 1979and the proportion of women in higher education has only grown.

Overall male enrollment numbers have increased since data was first collectedin 1869because of general population growth and larger numbers of degree-granting institutions. But thepercentage of degreesconferred on men hasshrunk at every degree level, per the National Center for Education Statistics.

The most recent data from 2020 graduates shows that, for women, thefour-year degree completion rateis 53.7%. For men, it’s 43.4%.

Richard Reeves, director of theAmerican Institute for Boys and Menand author of 2022’s ""Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It,"" said two main factors drive the college completion gap.

One reason is that they're less likely to enroll than women, and the other is that they are less likely than women to complete a degree within four years, he said.

The disparity is more pronounced for Black and Latino men, who are more than 10 percentage points less likely than white and Asian males toattend orcompletecollege, according to the American Council on Education.

Since 2008, male college enrollment has hovered around 8.4 million in the U.S.per academic year, while female enrollment has steadily increased. In 2022, 57% of male high school graduatesenrolledin college, compared with 66% of their female peers. That 57% is the same as in 1964.

""The gender gap in college is reflecting the gaps that have been accumulating all the way through the K-12 system, as opposed to causing them,"" Reeves said. ""It's not like girls and boys come out of high school equally prepared for college, and then something happens. The girls come out significantly ahead of the boys, especially on things like GPA.""

Fewer men think college is beneficial to their post-high school careers, and fewer men want to continue school when they are already lagging their female peers in K-12, Reeves said. Campus-specific surveys show that men increasingly report feeling alienated on college campuses, he said. ""They'll very often say that they'll find that the male students are the ones who just don't quite feel it ‘fits,’"" Reeves said.

Gallego said men now ""have the lowest college attainment rate ever.""

Gallego’s spokesperson told us he was referring to the share of college students who are men.

Although male enrollment raw numbers are higher today than they were in 1869 because of general population growth, National Center for Education Statistics data shows that men have fallen behind women in higher education enrollment and degree completion. National Center for Education Statistics data shows four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low.

Data from 2020 graduates shows that for women, the four-year degree completion rate is 53.7%, and for men, it’s 43.4%.

"Philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates said climate change ""will not lead to humanity’s demise.""",True,"In October 2025, aclaim(archived) circulated online that philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates said climate change ""will not lead to humanity's demise.""
Gates has been a longtime supporter of innovations to reduce global warming and combat climate change, and he previouslywarnedthat, if unchecked, the death rate from climate change could be five times worse than that from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Gates published abook, ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,"" that discussed how to reach worldwide zero greenhouse-gas emissions.
One Reddit user who shared the alleged quotewrote, ""Bill Gates softens stance on climate change stating it 'will not lead to humanity's demise.'""
Bill Gates softens stance on climate change stating it 'will not lead to humanity's demise'byu/Sufficient-History71inclimate
Userson X(archived),Facebook(archived),Instagram(archived),Threads(archived) andBluesky(archived) also shared the alleged quote.
Gates did write those words in amemopublished on his website on Oct. 28, 2025. In that memo, Gates looked ahead to theCOP30 climate summitin Brazil and argued that ""although climate change will have serious consequences—particularly for people in the poorest countries—it will not lead to humanity's demise.""
Gates blamed a ""doomsday outlook"" on climate change for focusing only on short-term goals rather than long-term solutions that could improve the lives of those most affected. He instead suggested that governments should ""put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies"" through reducing the cost of choosing ""Green"" and improving agriculture and health in poorer countries.
Given the above, we found the quote to be correctly attributed.
The full quote from Gates'memoread (emphasis ours):
There's a doomsday view of climate change that goes like this:
In a few decades, cataclysmic climate change will decimate civilization. The evidence is all around us—just look at all the heat waves and storms caused by rising global temperatures. Nothing matters more than limiting the rise in temperature.
Fortunately for all of us, this view is wrong.Although climate change will have serious consequences—particularly for people in the poorest countries—it will not lead to humanity's demise.People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further.
Some users argued that Gates' memo indicated a softening on his stance on climate change. Gates wrote:
I know that some climate advocates will disagree with me, call me a hypocrite because of my own carbon footprint (which I fully offset with legitimate carbon credits), or see this as a sneaky way of arguing that we shouldn't take climate change seriously.
To be clear: Climate change is a very important problem. It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition. Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people's lives.

"“As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union.”",True,"As Californians assess the damages and recovery costs from widespread wildfires in greater Los Angeles, lawmakers and President Donald Trump are floating ideas for overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Trump has suggested eliminating the agency, something that would require congressional action. Heordereda council form to review the agency and deliver a report in six months. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress may want to attachconditions, such as a debt limit increase, to California aid.

That’s a ""shameful"" idea, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Jan. 26 onNBC’s ""Meet the Press.""

Schiff said Congress should not tie unrelated policy objectives to aid or view disaster aid requests through a partisan lens.

""And let me say this, as a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union,"" Schiff said.

Responding to Johnson’s comments calling the idea of conditioning California aid ""a common-sense notion,"" U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., echoed Schiff’s sentiment.

""California is the largest contributor of tax revenue to the federal treasury by far,"" Padilla wroteJan. 27 on X. ""In 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion more to the federal government than it received. Louisiana took $34.5 billion more federal dollars than it paid. Who is subsidizing whom here?""

We heard similar statements during Trump’s first presidency that California is a""donor"" state– sending more money to the federal government than it gets in return. We found that Schiff cited a credible academic analysis, which requires some explanation.

How a policy group calculates states’ ‘balance of payments’

A Schiff spokesperson citedanalysisfrom the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York.

For several years, the institute hasexaminedthe amount of federal taxes paid by each state’s residents and businesses compared with the amount of federal funding the state receives. The institute refers to the difference of those two numbers as the state’s ""balance of payments"" — a phrase used by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. who was elected to the Senate in 1976 and served 24 years.

The institute’s most recentanalysis, published in 2024, showed that California’s balance of payments was greater than any other state in the nation.

California paid $83.1 billion more in federal taxes than it received from the federal government — a difference greater than any other state when measured in sheer dollars.

The state remained a standout when its population was considered, but it didn’t lead all states. The analysis showed that per capita, Californians paid $2,129 more in federal taxes than they received — that’s more than all but three other states.



So, Schiff was right that California’s federal funding contributions far outweigh what it gets from the federal government in return, but the disaster aid comparison is not as much of a straight line.

""The federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid,"" said Joel Tirado, an institute spokesperson. ""FEMA funding comes from general revenue aggregated nationally. So, it isn’t possible to know how much of California’s taxes go to disaster relief specifically.""

Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, said policymakers in states such as California sometimes object that their taxpayers are subsidizing other states' taxpayers. But taxpayers are not being treated differently from one state to another. Low-income and high-income taxpayers will receive the same treatment whether they live in California, Nebraska or Arkansas, Walczak said.

""The difference is that California has more high earners than other states, and under a progressive tax and transfer system, high earners face progressively higher tax burdens which serve, in part, to fund programs that benefit lower-income households,"" Walczak said. ""It's not that Californians are subsidizing Arkansans: it's that high earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else face higher tax burdens than low earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else.""

Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan taxpayer advocacy group, said he agreed with Schiff’s general point because California’s economy and its contributions to federal revenues exceed every other state.

""That’s because federal lawmakers have taken those commingled funds generated from the income tax, customs duties, and excise taxes and redistributed them through federal programs,"" Sewell said.

Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank, said disaster response programs are implemented by many agencies and departments, which receive most of their funding fromsupplemental appropriations.

""That money ultimately comes from tax receipts, and California definitely pays more than its share,"" Franklin said. ""Putting things in per capita terms, as (the Rockefeller report) did, is helpful for thinking about tax burden per person. But total receipts are much more relevant to this question.""

Schiff said, ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union.""

Schiff was citing the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s analysis of 2022 data. It showed California paid $83 billion to the federal government more than it received. This is not surprising since California is the most populous state. When that difference is calculated per capita, however, the figures showed that, compared with California, three other states paid more to the federal government than they received.

We rate this statement Mostly True.

— Alex Cole (@acnewsitics)September 10, 2025
The claim was true. In a 2016 textmessageto his former law school roommate, Vance wrote: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a**hole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler. How's that for discouraging?""
The recipient of the message — Josh McLaurin, now a Democratic state senator in Georgia — made the text message publicin 2022, and several reputable news outlets corroborated its legitimacy at that time. Since then, Vance has acknowledged his past remark comparing Trump to ""America's Hitler,"" stressing his views on the former president have changed.
For instance, in a 2022 statement to VICE for an article titled ""Trump-Endorsed Candidate JD Vance Once Said Trump Might Be 'America's Hitler',"" a campaign manager for Vance said:
It's laughable that the media treats JD not liking Trump 6 years ago as some sort of breaking news, when they've already covered it to death since this race began. Clearly, President Trump trusts that JD is a genuine convert, as out of all the Republican candidates running, he endorsed JD and concluded that he is the strongest America First conservative in the race. … Despite the leftwing media's obsession with this old news, JD is proud to have President Trump's support and will stand with him to fight back against the radical left and the establishment RINOs as Ohio's next Senator.
In July 2024, after Trump announced Vance as his vice presidential nominee, various reputable news outlets, such asReuters, theBBCandThe Guardian, cited the 2016 text message again.
In a July 16, 2024,interview, Fox News' Sean Hannity asked Vance about his past comments about Trump, including the ""America's Hitler"" remark. Vance said ""I don't hide from that,"" in reference to his documented skepticism of Trump in the past. But, Vance said, Trump's time in the White House ""changed my mind"" (emphasis ours):
SEAN HANNITY: But you didn't have the nicest things to say about [Trump] back in 2016, which seems like a long while ago right now.You know, you literally said, you texted a friend that Trump was a cynical a**hole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad and might even prove useful, and that he's America's Hitler.And you compared him to cultural heroin in the Atlantic monthly. And I'll tell you Trump's response, but you said that then. What do you say to people that say, ""Whoa, wait a minute. What did he mean?""
JD VANCE:Sean, I don't hide from that. I was certainly skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016, but President Trump was a great president and he changed my mind. I think he changed the minds of a lot Americans, because again, he delivered that peace and prosperity. If you go back to what I thought in 2016, another thing that was going on Sean is, I bought into the media's lies and distortions. I bought into this idea that somehow he was gonna be so different, a terrible threat to democracy.
McLaurin, who roomed with Vance when they were attending Yale Law School,wroteon X on July 15, 2024: ""I'm the guy JD Vance sent the 'America's Hitler' text to in 2016. He was my roommate in law school.""

"“ICE will now become the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency, bigger than the FBI, bigger than the DEA.”",True,"As news of immigration raids permeate Americans’ social media feeds, news broadcasts and neighborhood meetings, critics of President Donald Trump’s tactics are warning his federal immigration force is gaining unprecedented strength.

Trump’s tax and spending law awards U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency charged with detaining and deporting people in the U.S. illegally, billions of dollars over the next four years.

""ICE will now become the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency, bigger than the FBI, bigger than the DEA,"" former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on the July 8Pod Save Americapodcast he co-hosts.

Other left leaning groups and people have made similar statements, includingSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., theBrennan Center for Justice at NYU school of lawandAaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group.

The new law clearly includes an enormous increase in spending for ICE, but does it make ICE the ""largest"" federal law enforcement agency? Favreau didn’t explain his metric for ""largest"" on the show, but he mentioned that the new law includes money to hire 10,000 ICE employees and build immigration detention beds.

We examined how ICE compares with the FBI and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in terms of funding and staffing. Favreau is right about the DEA. As to the FBI, we found that Favreau’s statement tracks based on some calculations about spending in the new law and ICE’s likely annual budget. But it is less certain when comparing ICE and FBI staffing numbers.

Here’s a wrinkle in these comparisons: We don’t yet know the future years’ annual base budget for ICE or the FBI. Congress will set the fiscal 2026 base budgets by Sept. 30.

How ICE compares to the FBI in size is significant because it shows how federal officials are prioritizing the nation’s enforcement needs. The FBIinvestigatesa broad range of crimes including terrorism, cyber crimes, violent and white collar crime and although some of those offenders could be immigrants, it includes a lot of crime committed by U.S. citizens.

Several emails to Crooked Media, home of Pod Save America, did not get a response.

ICE is one ofnineagencies within the Department of Homeland Security — and it’s worth noting that DHS itselftouts on its websitethat all agencies combined make DHS ""the largest federal law enforcement agency with approximately 80,000 officers across nine agencies and offices.""

The law Trump signed provides about$165 billionfor Homeland Security, including $46.5 billion to finish building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Its ICE-specific budgetary provisions add up to about $75 billion over four years.

The FBI and the DEA are part of theJustice Department. The DEA has a budget of about $2.6 billion and employsabout 10,000 peoplethroughout the world, making it easily smaller than both the FBI and ICE, no matter how you look at it.

Reichlin-Melnick told us he based his own ICE comparisons on funding.

""I’ve been saying that ICE will become the nation’s highest-funded federal law enforcement agency, with a budget larger than the combined budget of the FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service, and Bureau of Prisons,"" Reichlin-Melnick wrote to PolitiFact.

Of the $75 billion going to ICE through September 2029, $45 billion is for 80,000 new detention beds. The remaining $30 billion will go toward hiring 10,000 new employees, removal operations and facility and information technology upgrades.

That works out to about $17.7 billion more per year through September 2029, bringing the total annual budget to about $27.7 billion. (ICE’s current annual budget is about $10 billion.)

That total amount for ICE adds up to more than the current annual budgets of the FBI, DEA and other law enforcement agencies including the Bureau of Prisons, according to theJustice Department.

If you look at the three agencies by staffing, the comparison is less certain.

As of April, the FBI had about38,000 employees,13,000of whom are special agents authorized to make arrests.

ICE has about20,000 employees, including6,100 deportation officers and 6,500 special agents authorized to make arrests. Under the new law, ICE’s force will grow to30,000 within four years — 10,000 of them officers, agents, investigators and support staff.

So although the FBI overall is larger than ICE now, ICE could surpass the FBI in the number of agents with authority to make arrests, depending on how hiring breaks down for the new 10,000  positions.

One caveat: ICE’s future annual budgets are unclear because the administration could spend the $75 billion sooner rather than later — meaning, not in equal measure across the four years, Migration Policy Institute spokesperson Michelle Mittelstadt said.

""Also, Congress is currently working on (fiscal year) 2026 appropriations, so they could change ICE’s annual budget then, too,"" Mittelstadt said.

The new law that Trump signed includes extra funding for ICE; it does not mention the annual base budget for ICE or the FBI for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.

Trump proposed that Congress provide$11.3 billionfor ICE, an increase over its current $10 billion. The FBI’s budget request is$10.1 billion; a reduction of $545 million and of at least 1,500 positions, including about 700 that are vacant, according to a JuneJustice Department budget and performance summary.

Other experts on ICE or the federal budget noted additional caveats.

John Sandweg, who served as acting director of ICE during part of Obama’s administration, told PolitiFact that more than one-third of ICE’s detention beds are operated by private prison companies.

""If you consider the guards and other facility personnel (most of whom technically work for the detention provider) as ICE employees, the agency is likely to be larger than the FBI,"" Sandweg said.

The Trump administration has also allowedfederal officials in other agencies, such as the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshals Service to enforce immigration law.

ICE has hundreds of agreementsdelegatingsome immigration authorities to state and local police.

""None of those would be counted as personnel in the ICE budget justification, but it would vastly increase the number of law enforcement personnel acting on behalf of ICE,"" said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy.

An example: Florida cooperates with ICE and in July opened Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention facility. The state will incur the upfront costs and seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Shelter and Services Program.

Favreau said, ""ICE will now become the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency, bigger than the FBI, bigger than the DEA.""

He’s right about ICE being bigger than DEA.

And ICE becomes the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency under Trump’s law compared with the FBI’s existing budget. But there are some unknowns: We don’t know if the $75 billion newly allocated to ICE will be spent evenly over four years or as a huge infusion in the first year, making the annual budget comparison  tricky. We also don’t know what will happen with the FBI’s annual budget over the next four years.

If the new ICE funds are allocated evenly over four years and based on current budget levels, that adds up to $27.7 billion annually for ICE, more than the FBI’s annual budget of about $10 billion and DEA’s $2.6 billion.

As to agency staffing, the FBI’s 38,000 workforce is greater than ICE’s 20,000 plus the expected 10,000 new hires. But ICE could surpass the FBI in the number of agents with authority to make arrests, depending on how the new hires shake out.

The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

The first reports of coronavirus — a group of viruses that includes COVID-19 and other diseases — go back to the 1930s; coronavirus did not originate with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. In 2013, one form of coronavirus was spreading in the Middle East.
In November 2025, an alleged X post from 2013 resurfaced that read, ""Corona virus....its coming."" Screenshots of the post circulated on multiple platforms, includingYouTube(archived),Instagram(archived) andReddit(archived), garnering millions of views.
The post is real. X user@Marco_Acortes posted ""Corona virus....its coming"" on the site then known as Twitteron June 3, 2013(archived):
Dozensofcommentersappeared shocked or confused as to how someone in 2013 could have seemingly predicted the COVID-19 pandemic, commonly referred to as ""corona"" or ""coronavirus,"" whichkilled at least 7 million peopleworldwide between January 2020 and November 2024.
We were unable to reach the user for comment regarding what influenced or inspired the post, and the account does not show any activity after 2016.
However,there's no reason to believe the user was referring to COVID-19 in particular.The term ""coronavirus"" has been in the medical lexicon since 1968, when scientists first named a group of viruses based on their microscopic crownlike structure.Scientists first observed diseases caused by viruses of this type in chickens in the early 1930s.It wasn't until the 1960s that researchers discovered the first strains of coronavirus in humans, and in 1968, an ""informal group of virologists""submitted their findingsto the scientific journal Nature, coining the term:
COVID-19 is also not the only deadly form of coronavirus found in humans. Ten years before the X post appeared, an outbreak of a strain of coronavirus in the same genus as the virus that causes COVID-19killed 774 peoplefrom more than two dozen countries.
According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, scientists have observedseven coronavirus diseasesin humans (they typically manifest in mild, coldlike symptoms), though only three have had severe pathogenic impact on populations over the past few decades: an initial outbreak ofsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) from 2002-03, periodic flare-ups of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) since 2012 and COVID-19 (SARS-2-CoV), which resulted in the 2020 pandemic that lastedjust over three years.
In June 2013, when the user wrote the X post, there was afresh outbreak of MERSin Saudi Arabia.Newsreleasesby the World Health Organization in June 2013 detailed additional cases that spread around the same time the post appeared online. While it's impossible to know what exactly inspired the user behind the post to warn his followers about coronavirus, the news reports coming out of the Middle East around the same time may have influenced the post.
Afterthe first SARS-CoV outbreak beginning in 2002, the user was also not the only one warning about the future impact of coronavirus.
Even before 2013, scientists claimed that a coronavirus pandemic could occur again at a much larger scale, given the right conditions. For example,one scientific study(archived) — initiallysubmitted in 2012— claimed SARS-CoV originated from bats, and possibly still existed in humans. ""These existing but undetected SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the reemergence of SARS,"" the study read.
In sum, the 2013 post that read, ""Corona virus....its coming,"" is authentic, and while it's not possible to know what exactly inspired the user to write it,humans have known about coronavirusessince the early 1930s — first in animals, then in humans and eventually on the scale of a global pandemic. Scientific studies published before the X post appeared warned of the potential impact of SARS-CoV potentially reemerging, making it possible the X user saw such reports to reach his conclusion."
“The (Evers) Era locked Wisconsin families into a 400‑year property tax increase.”,True,"While Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is retiring from political life, one policy willremain part of his legacy— and become a talking point in Democratic and Republican campaigns to succeed him.

That’s the ""400-year veto,"" the colloquial name for Evers’maneuver in the 2023-25 state budgetthat essentially changed the game for public school funding.

In April, thestate Supreme Court upheld itas an allowable use of the governor’s veto powers, which are considered the most expansive in the country. But it’s been a continued source of debate.

""The (Evers) Era locked Wisconsin families into a 400‑year property tax increase,"" Americans for Prosperityposted on Xon July 28, 2025, four days after Evers announced he wouldn’t seek reelection.

""His actions are now our problem,"" said the conservative group,which advocatesfor policies such as income tax cuts and school choice.

The graphic includes Evers’ two lieutenant governors — Sara Rodriguez,who is now running for governor herself, and Mandela Barnes, who was out of the office by the time Evers made the veto in 2023.

The 400-year veto has gotten plenty of attention, but not as much scrutiny into how school districts will use the funding increases — and what that means for your future property taxes.

We’ll take a closer look at a few key questions.

Let’s start with understanding what the veto actually did.

School districts have state-imposed limits on how much money they can take in throughtwo sources: State general aid and property taxes. The veto raises those limits by $325 per student, per year, until 2425.

So, an initial question is whether school districts will take advantage of those increases or forgo them.

When we reached out to Americans for Prosperity’s Wisconsin chapter for backup, state director Megan Novak said ""history and data point to the reasonable conclusion that Gov. Evers’ veto can and will raise property taxes.""

The group pointed to astate Department of Public Instruction spreadsheetthat showed only about 14% of the state’s 421 school districts taxed below their limits in the 2024-25 school year.

Dan Rossmiller, executive director of theWisconsin Association of School Boards, said it’s ""theoretically possible"" that a school district would not choose to levy the maximum amount.

But ""it’s unlikely that it would, given that inflation is running between 2 and 3% right now,"" he said.

As school districts and the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureaupointed out in 2023, the $325 per year doesn’t actually keep pace with inflation.

It’s safe to say school districts will take advantage of the increases.

Does that equate to higher property taxes, though?

Let’s remember the second part of those revenue limits: State general aid.

To the dismay of some Democrats, the new state budget — a compromise between Republicans and Evers — did not include increases to general school aid.

And theLegislative Fiscal Bureau projected in 2023that if lawmakers didn’t provide that aid in this budget, school districts could raise local taxes by around $260 million in 2025-26 and $520 million in 2026-27.

Areport from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forumfound property tax levies for K-12 schools rose $327 million in 2024. That was driven by the $325 boost, but alsofunding referendums approved by voters.

We’ll get a better picture of the 2025 numbers come fall, when school districtsset their tax levies.

""In general, the larger the revenue limit increase, the larger the property tax increase — unless state lawmakers also significantly raise general school aids,"" the report explained.

Because there were no general aid increases in the 2025-27 budget, expect K-12 property taxes to go up.

Onto the final part of the claim: Are these property tax increases guaranteed for the next 400 years?

Rossmiller argued it’s not necessarily the case that Evers ""locked"" Wisconsinites into a 400-year property tax increase, for a few reasons.

One, the Legislature could boost general school aids in future state budgets, or increasecreditsmeant to reduce tax bills.

Lawmakers ""could provide enough money to negate any property tax increase, if they choose to,"" Rossmiller said.

Another reason this increase might not last for the full 400 years?

GOP lawmakers aretrying to repealthe law, an effort that could succeed if a Republican replaces Evers as governor and Republicans maintain legislative control.

Property taxpayers are ""locked into it, until such time that the Legislature changes (the law),"" Rossmiller said.

Republicans could repeal the law, Democrats could provide more general school aid, or either party could completely overhaul the way schools get funding, for example.

Still, we can’t predict when the state government will switch partisan control. And at PolitiFact Wisconsin, we rate claims based on current law — even if it’s likely to change one day.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, said ""the (Evers) Era locked Wisconsin families into a 400‑year property tax increase.""

There’s reason to believe school districts will keep using those $325 per student increases as they deal with inflation.

And, the new budget included no increases to general school aids, meaning districts are likely to raise property taxes as they did in 2024.

While no one expects the law — and permanent increases in property taxes — to stay in place for all 400 years, we also can’t rate the claim based on what we don’t know about the future.

Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

That fits here.

"Hikers Steve and Natalie Brody went missing while hiking in Alaska's Denali National Park in 2017, and their bodies were found in a glacier crevasse six years later.",False,"In summer 2025, Facebook users andYouTubechannelsshared astory(archived) claiming that the bodies of Steve and Natalie Brody, two hikers who vanished in Alaska's Denali National Park in 2017, were found six years later in a glacier crevasse.
According toFacebookpostssharingthe alleged story, the pair vanished while on a remote trail in Alaska's Denali National Park in July 2017. Days before the hikers' ""GPS beacon went dark,"" they sent a final satellite message that read, ""Reached the Tlat River. All good,"" the posts claimed.
A search team later found the hikers' tent in a valley, but their sleeping bags and hiking boots were missing, the posts said. Their disappearance ""remained a mystery"" for six years until climbers reportedly found their bodies frozen in a glacier crevasse in 2023, according the posts. The posts claimed the two were ""dressed in oversized winter gear that didn't match their original supplies.""
The posts continued:
The discovery raised disturbing questions. Steve had suffered a crushed wrist and a violently removed eye, while Natalie bore only minor bruises. Around her neck hung a Swedish passport belonging to Lars Anderson, a man who had vanished in Norway's Jotunheimen National Park in 2009—with no known connection to the Brodys.Theories swirled: Was it a bizarre encounter with a hermit? A case of foul play? Or something more inexplicable? Alaska State Police offered only minimal speculation, leaving the public to grapple with the eerie details.
The posts also included purported images of the hikers and their frozen bodies, as well as a photo of a mountain landscape.
(Ancient World on Facebook)
Multiple Snopes readers asked us to confirm whether the story was authentic.
However, the story was false. Federal and state officials told Snopes they did not have any record of such a missing-persons case and resulting death investigation.
""This is not a case that happened in Denali National Park and Preserve,"" a spokesperson for the park told Snopes via email.
Likewise, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Public Safety said, ""From my records search, Alaska State Troopers were not involved in a search and rescue or body recovery for anyone named Steve and Natalie Brody.""
A Google searchalso found no reputable news outlets reporting on the story, which would likely be the case if the rumor were true.
An examination of photos included in Facebook posts and YouTube videos sharing the false story indicated that some were likely created with the help of artificial-intelligence software.
For example, the AI-detection platform Sightengine estimated a 99% probability that the photo claiming to show the hikers was adeepfake, or an image that was generated or heavily edited using AI. Hive, another AI-detection platform, also flagged the image as likely containing ""AI-generated or deepfake content.""
Reverse image searches did not return any credible matches for the photo, further suggesting that it was created with the help of AI.
(Sightengine AI-detection platform)
It was not entirely clear whether the purported photo of the frozen bodies used in the Facebook posts was AI-generated, as detection platforms provided differing responses. However, a reverse image search also failed to return any credible matches for the image.
A reverse image search of the mountain landscape photo led us to astock video on the website Shutterstock(archived). Whoever created the image appeared to have taken a screenshot from the video and added a red arrow.
The Facebook posts appeared to have been an adaptation of lengthier fake stories about Steve and Natalie Brody that were first sharedonYouTube(archivedhereandhere).
Another purported image of the pair used inone of the YouTube videos(archived) probably contained AI-generated or deepfake content, Hive found. Sightengine also estimated a 99% probability that the image was AI-generated.

Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, social media users circulated multiple alleged statements by the conservative activist, some of which wereaccurately attributedand others werenot. Among them was the claim Kirk once called George Floyd a ""scumbag.""
Snopes readers emailed and searched our website about the purported quote involving Floyd, the Black man who died while in a chokehold by a white police officer in May 2020, prompting protests against racism in policing worldwide.
""George Floyd was a father too and Charlie Kirk called him a 'scumbag,'"" read one Xpost(archived) with over 19 million views.

It was true Kirk called Floyd a ""scumbag"" during a 2021 public appearance in Mankato, Minnesota, according to avideoof that event. He apparently made the comment in reference to Floyd'salleged criminal historyand the circumstances surrounding his death.
Kirk's exact words were: ""I am also going to offer some context and some nuance about the death of George Floyd that no one dares to say out loud. Which is that this guy was a scumbag. Now, does that mean he deserves to die? That's two totally different things — of course not.""

Below is our transcript of the relevant portion of Kirk's speech, with emphasis added for clarity:
On May 25th, 2020, up in Minneapolis, a cell phone video changed the trajectory of our entire nation. In this state.
The reason why our tour is called the CRT [Critical Racism Tour] Tour is because of George Floyd's death and the misinterpretation of that. And I'm not going to go on this endless soapbox defending Derek Chauvin, I think he's kind of not a great person. ButI am also going to offer some context and some nuance about the death of George Floyd that no one dares to say out loud. Which is that this guy was a scumbag. Now, does that mean he deserves to die? That's two totally different things — of course not.
After that comment, Kirk listed a series of accusations about Floyd's background,criminal historyand cause of death — all with varying degrees of legitimacy. The Associated Press, reporting on the event,describedthat section of the speech as ""an avalanche of aspersions and debunked claims about Floyd.""
Kirk claimed protests and debates following Floyd's death were based on a ""misinterpretation"" of the event.
At the time, several media outlets reported on the event and Kirk's comments about Floyd, including theMinnesota Reporterand University of Alabama student-run publicationThe Crimson White.
The ""scumbag"" statement is just one of many purported quotes by Kirk circulating after his death. For example, social media users are sharing anauthentic quotehe made about some prominent Black women not having""the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,"" as well as afalse rumorabout him supposedly saying gay people should be stoned to death."
The U.S. Census included a citizenship question “for over 150 years” before the Obama administration.,False,"Before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed James Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, as attorney general, Uthmeier worked in the first Trump administration in the Department of Commerce, which oversees the U.S. Census Bureau.Now Uthmeier’s past is present after President Donald Trumpcalled fora rare, mid-decade census to exclude immigrants in the U.S. illegally.""During my time working in the first Trump Admin, the Supreme Ct (5-4 decision) blocked us from asking in the Census whether someone is a U.S. citizen (though it was asked for over 150 years, prior to Obama admin),"" Uthmeierposted Aug. 24 on X. ""Illegals shouldn’t be included in apportionment.""

Apportionment is how the federal government determines how many seats each state receives in the U.S. House of Representatives. It’s based on population figuresreported in the census, including people who are not U.S. citizens.

Uthmeier is right that the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Trump’s 2019attempt to add a citizenship questionin the 2020 census. Buthe’s wrongthat the census asked the question for 150 years before President Barack Obama came along.The 2010 census broke from tradition, but the change was in the works before Obama took office, and the Census Bureau continues to ask about citizenship in an annual survey.

""The Obama administration did not change the census question related to citizenship,"" saidTerri Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer and census expert. Instead, the question was  included in the annual American Community Survey, which replaced a long-form census questionnaire. Not everyone who received a census form received the question.

Joining other states jockeying for congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterms, FloridaRepublican legislatorsconvened a select committee on congressional redistricting to look at the state’s map.

PolitiFact contacted Uthmeier’s office for comment but did not hear back by publication.

Uthmeier said a citizenship question was asked in the census ""for over 150 years,"" but it has not been part of the decennial census for all U.S. households that entire time.

The earliestU.S. census in 1790asked for the head of the family’s name and number of people in the household, including enslaved people.The first version of a census citizenship question appearedin 1820, asking each household ""the number of foreigners not naturalized."" Until 1920, it was asked only of adult men — women and children automatically had thesame citizenship statusas their husbands or fathers.Some form of the citizenship question has been included as a general question every decade since 1890 (but not asked of all households), with the exception of 1960, which focused on place of birth.The last time the Census Bureau came close to asking every household about citizenship status wasin 1950, when census workers knocked on doors and interviewed residents. They asked where each person was born and, in a follow-up question for those born outside the U.S., asked if they were anaturalized citizen.In 1970, the Census Bureau started distributing two different questionnaires: a short form sent to most households and a long form sent to about 1 in 6 households. Only the long version asked about citizenship.

In 2000, for example, thelong-form questionnaireasked respondents, ""Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?""

Theshort formasked for the basics, such as name, date of birth, sex and race. It continued not to ask about citizenship in1980,1990and2000.

In 2010, the census eliminated the long-form questionnaire in favor of a 10-questionshort-form questionnairethat didn’t ask about citizenship.The census bureau had started collecting demographic and socioeconomic information through an alternative questionnaire — theAmerican Community Survey, or ACS, in 2005. The annual survey is sent to about3.5 million householdsandcontinuesto ask about citizenship, among other topics.Plans to stop using the long-form census started years before Obama took office, during former President George W. Bush’s administration.""To deal with some of these challenges at the beginning of the decade, the 2010 census was re-engineered to build a better, faster and simpler census. The plan was to leverage technology, eliminate the long form and conduct a short-form-only decennial census,"" Carlos Gutierrez, the commerce secretary under Bush, testified to Congress in 2008,according to The New York Times.Severalgovernmentreportsfrom the early 2000s concluded that the American Community Survey produced the same estimates as the long-form census.""The ACS includes a question on citizenship, as the long-form did. Therefore, President Obama did not change the content of the 2010 Census,"" Lowenthal said. ""Besides, Obama did not take office until 2009 — too late to change the content of the census without risking significant adverse consequences for census operations and, therefore, accuracy.""The questions on the decennial census ""have never been political until now,"" said Misty Lee Heggeness, a University of Kansas associate professor and former U.S. Census Bureau economist. ""Changes made to previous census forms had to do with innovations related to survey implementation and data collection and costs.""Census directorsappointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents have previously agreed that a question on citizenship would discourage responses and undermine census accuracy. Heggeness co-authored a March 2025peer-reviewed studythat supports that perspective.Heggeness said the point of the census is to get an accurate count ""of all the people in the United States’ borders,"" asmandated by the U.S. Constitution.""It’s about getting as many people as possible to respond because an undercount can cause a lot of complications in the following decade,"" she said.

Uthmeier said citizenship status was asked in the U.S. Census ""for over 150 years"" prior to the Obama administration.The last time the decennial census came close to asking every household about citizenship status was in 1950, when it was a follow-up question for foreign-born respondents. Subsequent censuses have asked the question only of a sample of households.In 2010, the Census Bureau took the citizenship question out of the long-form questionnaire as part of changes planned under the Bush administration. The Census Bureau still asks the question of 3.5 million households each year through the American Community Survey.We rate this claim False.PolitiFact Staff Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."

The email, along with thousands of other documents from the Epstein estate, is available toview in a Google folderprovided by the committee in itsnews release(archived).
Epstein sent the email to Larry Summers several weeks after Trump's first presidential inauguration. Summers, who was Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is also a former president of Harvard University and later served as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama.

The 2017USA Today article(archived) that Epstein linked to in the email reported that Obama vacationed with his wife, Michelle Obama, in the British Virgin Islands, where he spent time with businessman Richard Branson and learned to kitesurf.
The mention of ""Ruemmler"" likely referred to Kathy Ruemmler, a top lawyer for Goldman Sachs andformer White House counsel to Obamawhosename appeared in other Epstein correspondence.
The full context of the email, including what prompted the message about Trump, remained unclear at the time of publication. Snopes could not immediately reach Summers for comment.
In response to our request for comment about the email exchange, a White House spokesperson sent a statement that did not address the message.
Summers announced on Nov. 19 that he would resign from the board of directors at OpenAI, whichhe joined in November 2023, amid scrutiny over his connection to Epstein,NBC News reported(archived).
Summers reportedly said in a statement: ""In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI. I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress.""
Several days earlier, Summers said he would step back from public commitments while continuing to teach at Harvard,according to The Harvard Crimson(archived). He also began to leave other organizations where he held various roles, the student newspaper reported.
According to The Crimson, the released documents included seven years of correspondence between Summers and Epstein. The documents reportedly showed that the two continued to exchange messages until July 5, 2019 — one day before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.
In a statementprovided to The Crimson, Summers wrote: ""I have great regrets in my life. As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.""

“My tariffs … are helping to slash the deficit this year by more than 25%.”,False,"As President Donald Trump faced questions about the economic impact of his trade policy, a White House social media post framed tariffs as essential for tackling federal deficits.

ANov. 12X Postfrom the White House included Trump’s Nov. 5 remarks to a business forum when he touted his administration’s efforts to reduce government and target ""waste, fraud and abuse."" He said the economy has been creating jobs in the private sector rather than in the government.

""My tariffs are bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars, and are helping to slash the deficit this year by more than 25%,"" the X post quoted Trump as saying.

The post received a community note — a crowdsourced fact-check — citing Treasury Department figures and data from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching arm.

Tariff revenues SMASH records—slashing the U.S. deficit by over 25%! Shrinking government spending, downsizing bloated bureaucracy, and unleashing a wave of American jobs. 🔥pic.twitter.com/CNzp5soKJ5

We found that Trump exaggerated the deficit's decline on his watch by a factor of 10.

""The deficit has not been meaningfully cut, much less slashed by 25%,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington, D.C.-based group that tracks budget policy.

The White House did not provide evidence to support the statement.

When the federal government’s 2025 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the Congressional Budget Officeposteda final calculation of the deficit for the 2025 fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, 2024.

The CBO reported a federal deficit of $1.775 trillion in fiscal year 2025. That represented a 2.3% decrease from the 2024 fiscal year deficit, which was $1.817 trillion.

The CBO also calculated the deficit as a share of gross domestic product. That fell from 6.3% in fiscal 2024 to 5.9% in fiscal 2025, a 0.4 percentage point drop. That was well short of a 25% drop, as well.

Trump served for all or part of nine months of the 2025 fiscal year, from January to September. If considering only the portions of the 2025 fiscal year when Trump was president, and comparing them with the same months in 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office, the deficit increased on Trump’s watch.

From January to September 2024, when Biden was president, the deficit was $1.064 trillion. From January to September 2025, when Trump was president, the deficit was $1.079 trillion, a 1.4% increase.

From January to October 2025, the federal governmentcollected$309.2 billion in tariff revenue, compared with $165.4 billion through the same point in 2024, an increase of $143.8 billion.

The White House has offered divergent plans for increased tariff revenue. Trump proposed on social media that Americans receive $2,000 tariff revenue dividends. If the administration pursues the dividend check idea —which would face a range of obstacles— that plan would eliminate much or all of the tariffs’ potential deficit-reducing impact.

Ellis said the tariff dividends likely would increase the federal deficit.

The Supreme Court is also weighing a challenge to Trump’s ability to impose tariffs under theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law he’s used aggressively in his second term. If the justices rule that he can’t use that law to impose tariffs, much of the tariff revenue could disappear.

Trump said his tariffs ""are helping to slash the deficit this year by more than 25%.""

The federal deficit has not fallen by 25% during Trump’s second term. The fiscal year 2025 deficit was 2.3% smaller than the fiscal 2024 deficit. When considering only the portions of the fiscal 2025 year when Trump was president, the deficit was higher on his watch than during the comparable months in 2024 under Biden.

Trump has proposed using tariff revenue to fund dividends for the American public, which would eliminate any deficit-reducing impact the tariffs could have.

“It's going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history.”,False,"At a September Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. boasted about a rural health initiative within President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

""It's going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history,""Kennedy said,responding to criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders said the law would harm patients and rural hospitals.

Kennedy was referring to the law’s five-year, $50 billionRural Health Transformation Program, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. GOP lawmakers have made similar claims about the program.

The fund was added to the bill at the last minute to secure support from Republican lawmakers who represent rural states. Some were concerned about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would harm rural America, wheremore than 150 hospitalshave stopped offering inpatient services or been shuttered completely since 2010, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina.

""The transformation fund was really talked about in the context of saving rural hospitals that would be facing these significant Medicaid cuts,"" said Carrie Cochran-McClain, National Rural Health Association chief policy officer. Medicaid is the joint state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers low-income people and those with disabilities.

So is Kennedy right in his description of the rural health fund as a historic cash infusion, or does it fail to acknowledge critical context?

Trump’s tax and spending law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by at least $137 billion by 2034, according to ananalysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. TheCongressional Budget Office predictsthe law will increase the overall number of uninsured patients by 10 million by 2034.

Rural health facilities disproportionately rely on Medicaid reimbursement to stay afloat. In 2023, 40.6% of children and 18.3% of adults under age 65 from rural areas and small townswere enrolled in Medicaid, according to the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. In metro areas, the rates were 38.2% and 16.3%, respectively.

The Trump administration argues that rural hospitals cannot rely on ""legacy"" funding sources like Medicaid and Medicare due to the programs' reimbursement structure, which ties payments to the number of services provided, a model that’s not financially sustainable for rural facilities with typically low patient volumes.

""Distinct from these other programs, the Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to provide a flexible source of investment"" to promote innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, the White Housewrote in a memo.

Here’s how it works: States can propose projects spearheaded by state agencies, health care providers, consultants, and vendors aimed at various purposes, such as improving technology, access to care, and workforce recruitment.

States can use only 15% of their transformation program funding for provider payments and can direct money to non-rural areas,according to KFF.

Half of the $50 billion will be evenly divided among states whose applications are approved —regardless of their rural and overall populations — according to the ""Notice of Funding Opportunity"" for the program.

The other half will be awarded based on ""the transformative possibilities"" of states’ grant proposals; how much they’ve committed to aligning their health policies with the Trump administration’s; and data on their rural population, rural health facilities, uncompensated care, and other measurements.

The application deadline is Nov. 5.

Michael Meit, director of the Center for Rural Health and Research at East Tennessee State University, said the rural health community is excited about the innovations the new program might foster, but he’d ""love for it to happen in the absence of these cuts that are going to devastate our rural health system.""

""It’s not going to fill the hole,"" Meit said.

KFF estimates that the rural health fund’s five-year, $50 billion investment is a little overa third of the expected lossof federal funding in rural areas that will be spread over 10 years. According to that analysis, Medicaid cuts over that period would tally at least $137 billion in rural areas.

That number doesn’t account for other reductions stemming from the same law, such as cuts to the ACA Marketplaces or the health-system revenue loss expected from an increase in the number of people without insurance.

These factors are important to note because the rural health program is a temporary initiative while reductions in federal spending are long-term.

Another issue is the difference in the program’s spirit. The rural health fund is focused on transforming the rural health care system — not providing continued funding to keep facilities open or making up for lost Medicaid funds. Even if it triggers successful innovations, there are doubts that those will happen in time to prevent rural health facilities from closing.

""There's a real misperception that somehow these funds are going to be able to save rural America or save rural hospitals,"" Cochran-McClain said.

Joseph Antos, a health policy expert and senior fellow emeritus at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Kennedy’s comment is something ""politicians say when they want to ignore the rest of the policies.""

""What they wanted was to say that they were creating a new program,"" Antos said. ""Well, this is a very inefficient way to distribute a relatively very small amount of money to hospitals that will incur much larger bad debt over the coming years, thanks to the cuts in Medicaid.""

Experts said that when viewed outside of mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, the $50 billion rural health fund does appear to be unrivaled, especially for a limited, five-year program.

Several mentioned the Hill-Burton Act as another program that significantly boosted rural health care. The law provided loans and grants thatmodernized or built 6,800 health facilities, many of which were in rural areas, from 1946 to 1997, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Incomplete funding data makes it difficult to account for inflation, said Kelsey Moran, an assistant professor and health economist at the University of Miami.

Butshe estimatedthat, during the life of the program, it spent $47 billionin 2024 dollars when using the Consumer Price Index, or $109 billion when using the CPI’s medical care index. The medical index has a higher inflation rate because health prices have risen more than overall prices.

Kennedy said the rural health fund is ""going to be the biggest infusion of federal dollars into rural health care in American history.""

The statement contains an element of truth because the new program could be the most significant one-time investment in rural health funding.

But it ignores critical facts and context that create a different impression.

Federal contributions to rural areas from Medicaid and Medicare easily dwarf this program’s $50 billion mark. The new fund offers states flexibility in how they can allocate resources, meaning there’s no guarantee that all the new funding will go to rural Americans’ health care. The program comes at the same time rural areas are expected to lose far more from Medicaid cuts and an increase in uninsured patients than what the rural health fund infusion can backfill.

Experts say the rural health fund’s cash infusion is canceled out by other parts of Trump’s tax and spending law that call for cuts and policy changes.

"Mike Holmgren, former coach of the Green Bay Packers, died in late August 2025.",False,"A rumorcirculatingin late August 2025 claimed former head coach of the Green Bay Packers football team, Mike Holmgren, was dead.
For example, an Aug. 26, 2025, a Facebook post on thePackers Powerhousegroup shared a photograph of Holmgren in a Green Bay Packers jacket, along with the caption:
GOODBYE TO A TRUE ICON 💔: The NFL community is devastated by the passing of former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike Holmgren. The man who reshaped Packers football in the 1990s, Holmgren built a dynasty around Brett Favre, rekindled the spirit of Titletown, and returned Lambeau Field to its place as the ultimate symbol of grit, discipline, and passion. Before his passing, he left a touching message for Packers fans – the people he always called ""the soul of the team""
The Packers Powerhouse Facebook group also posted a link to anarticleabout the purported death in the comments section, which led to an advertisement-filled article on the sport.clubofsocial.com website. Otherpostson Facebook andXshared the same rumor and story link.
But we found no available evidence on news outlets that Holmgren had died. Had he actually died, the news would be widely reported on sports pages as well as the social media accounts of the Green Bay Packers, the National Football League (NFL) and other affiliated organizations. As such, we rate this claim as false.
A check of the Green Bay Packerssocial mediapages(where he washead coachfrom 1992-1998) as well as theNFLpageson Aug. 25 and Aug. 26 found no information about Holmgren's death. We even looked at the officialsocial mediaaccountsof theSeattle Seahawks, where he was the head coach from 1999 to 2008 and found no such report.
Thearticleon sport.clubofsocial.com also gave no official reason for his death, nor did it link to an authentic source, like a family member or his representatives. The article instead made a number of general observations about his career:
As the football world reflects on his life and career, there is no doubt that Mike Holmgren will always be remembered as a pioneer, a teacher, and a man who dedicated his life to the sport he loved. His vision transformed a struggling franchise into a dynasty, his mentorship produced generations of leaders, and his words continue to resonate with the fans who adored him. Though he may be gone, the legacy he built lives on in every cheer at Lambeau Field and every memory of the glory days he helped create.
We reached out to the sports agency representing Holmgren and will update this story if we get more information.

“Eliminate school choice” is on Susan Crawford’s agenda.,False,"With less than a month until Election Day, the race that will determine the ideological control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court is full speed ahead.

Liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford and conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who also served as state attorney general under former Gov. Scott Walker, are blasting each other on issues that are sure to ignite their bases, even though the contest istechnically non-partisan. Crawford’s allies have dogged Schimel onabortion, while Schimel’s have sought to paint Crawford assoft on crime.

As of late, the accusations have also included the topic of school choice.

In aFeb. 6, 2025 post on X, ""Eliminate School Choice"" was one item on a bulleted list of what the Schimel campaign described as Crawford’s ""radical and dangerous"" agenda.

This wasn’t the only time it’s come up. Schimel’s campaign Facebook pageposted Jan. 26, ""If Susan Crawford wins, school choice doesn’t stand a chance.""

Proponents of school choice generally support making public funds available for students to attend private schools. Wisconsin has fourschool voucher programs— in Milwaukee, in Racine, a statewide program and a program forstudents with disabilities— which use tax-funded vouchers to cover the cost of tuition for students at private schools. The students are typically from lower- and middle-income families.

The number of Wisconsin students who are enrolled in voucher programshas been on the rise for years.Close to 55,000were enrolled during the 2023-’24 school year, according to the state Department of Public Instruction.

Public opinion polling on school choice is limited, but in aJune 2024 Marquette University Law School poll, 42% of respondents nationwide said school choice as an education policy has been a complete success or mostly a success, while 25% said it was a complete failure or mostly a failure.

Although school choice has historically been a thorny issue in Wisconsin, it hasn’t been a key point in this race, and there’s also not a case about it before the Supreme Court right now. That made us at PolitiFact Wisconsin wonder where the Schimel claim was coming from.

Is eliminating school choice on Crawford’s agenda if she’s elected to the state’s highest court? Let’s take a look at the facts.

Schimel’s campaign pointed us to three pieces of evidence for the claim:

First, that Crawfordis endorsed by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which represents the state’s public school teachers — and subsequently that WEACsupporteda 2023 lawsuitfunded by the liberal Minocqua Brewing Super PAC seeking to eliminate funding for Wisconsin’s taxpayer-funded school voucher programs and independent charter schools.

Second, that shewon a lawsuit in 2016that protected the powers of the state superintendent of public instruction (which at the time was Tony Evers, who, of course, is now governor) and blocked then-Gov. Walker and the Legislature from having more of a say in education policy. Crawford was working as an attorney for Madison-based law firm Pines Bach at the time.

And third, that Crawford has called current Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofskya mentor, and Karofskydissented on a 2020 court rulingthat found Dane County health officials could not prohibit private schools from holding in-person classes during the pandemic.

The third point is a stretch no matter how you slice it. It doesn’t include any actions or words from Crawford on schools. So we’ll set that aside.

The other two are certainly indicators that Crawford is a supporter of public schools.

It’d be hard to earn the WEAC endorsement without being one. (A WEAC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about whether the decision to endorse Crawford involved her personal views on school choice.)

And in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story covering her successful 2016 lawsuit, Crawford isquoted as saying, ""This is an important victory for public education … this (Walker) administration has clearly had a goal of privatizing education to a large degree and that’s certainly run counter to the superintendent’s (Evers) mission.""

She also wasamong the attorneys who sued seeking to overturn the Walker-led Act 10, which effectively ended collective bargaining for Wisconsin public employee unions, including those of public school teachers.

But litigating on behalf of public schools is not proof that Crawford plans to attack Wisconsin’s school choice program from the bench, nor that she has specified it as part of an agenda. The evidence Schimel’s team provided does not include any personal opinions Crawford has expressed or rulings she has made from the bench specifically about school choice.

Searches of Crawford’s past public statements and work in private practice and as a circuit court judge did not unearth anything specifically related to school choice.

Crawford spokesperson Derrick Honeyman confirmed as much in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin: ""In her career, Judge Crawford has never taken any position on this issue or suggested the elimination of school choice programs.""

For what it’s worth, it’s not clear that Crawford would get the chance to weigh in on school choice if elected. In December 2023, the Supreme Court — already liberal-controlled at the time —unanimously declinedto hear the Minocqua Brewing Super PAC lawsuit that sought to eliminate funding for voucher programs and charter schools. The suit could still be introduced in a lower court, but it hasn’t been.

Schimel’s campaign said ""eliminate school choice"" is on Crawford’s agenda.

At PolitiFact,the burden is on the speakerto prove that a claim is accurate. The evidence offered here does not do so, and outside evidence to support the claim was not found.

We rate this claim False."

The story's headline and subheading read, ""Herr Goebbels Angered By Anti-Nazi Wit. Comedians Banned For Humorous Remarks on Leaders.""

Someusersquestionedif the article was real. The oldestpostlocated in Snopes' search appeared on Sept. 18, on the morning after Kimmel's suspension.
The image truly showed a genuine newspaper article printed by The Montreal Daily Star, and potentially other newspapers, on Feb. 4, 1939. Newspapers.com, a website archiving over 1 billion pages from more than 29,400 newspapers, hosted the entirearticle(page), which Snopes transcribed and has presented later in this story.
This fact-check article first lays out all of the context regarding the present-day situation involving Kimmel, Colbert and the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, then provides the entire newspaper article — again, an article longer than the one users commonly shared — in a full-length transcript.
On July 18, on the morning following CBS' and Paramount Global's cancellation of Colbert's show, Trump said he ""loved"" Colbert's firing, and targeted Kimmel as being ""next."" He also referenced Jimmy Fallon, the host of ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" Thepost(archived) on his Truth Social platform read, ""I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.""
ABC's initial decision to suspend Kimmel's show in September followed remarks from Brendan Carr,appointedby Trump as chair of the Federal Communications Commission, and included ABC affiliate owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group initially announcing they would not air the show.
On the day before Kimmel's suspension, Carr appeared on a conservative-politicalpodcast, saying people speaking on networks with FCC-granted licenses have ""an obligation to operate in the public interest."" In speaking about Kimmel, he said, ""We can get into some ways that we've been trying to reinvigorate the public interest and some changes that we've seen. But frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action frankly on Kimmel or you know there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.""
The alleged controversy leading to Kimmel's suspensionstemmedfrom jokes made during his nightly monologues, specifically targeting U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. Those jokes mentioned, butdid not target, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose fatal shooting occurred on Sept. 10 during a stop on his ""The American Comeback Tour"" on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.
Hours after the shooting, Kimmelposted(archived) a message in an image on Instagram reading, ""Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.""
Kimmel returned to the airwaves on Sept. 23, in a lengthymonologuefeaturing the late-night host thanking people who supported him, speaking directly about Carr's podcast remarks, continuing to target Trump with jokes and addressing Kirk's shooting directly.
An emotional Kimmel told his audience, ""I do want to make something clear because it's important to me as a human. And that is you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram of the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion, and I meant it, and I still do."" He also said Erika Kirk inspired him after she forgave the person she believed responsible for her husband's shooting, during a memorial gathering in Arizona.
Prior to ABC lifting the suspension of Kimmel's show, Reutersreportedthe matter reflected ""the latest demonstration"" of Trump's power to place political pressure on media, entertainment and digital platforms:
ABC's abrupt suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission is the latest demonstration of the power President Donald Trump wields to bend media, entertainment and digital platforms to his will, as he uses political pressure to mute criticism and punish institutions he sees as biased against him.
The move, which came after Kimmel's remarks about the accused killer of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has jolted the U.S. media and entertainment industries and intensified free-speech fears as the Trump-appointed FCC chair Brendan Carr threatened to revoke broadcast licenses from stations that carry what he called ""garbage.""
We transcribed the entire authentic newspaperarticlefrom February 1939, including keeping intact all word usage and spelling from the time period:
Herr Goebbels Angered By Anti-Nazi Wit
Comedians Banned For Humorous Remarks on Leaders
BERLIN, Feb. 4 — (U.P.) —When Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph Goebbels yesterday blasted Germany's cafe society, he called it ""society rabble and intellectual snobs,"" for laughing at comedians who make Nazi leaders the butts of their jokes.
Goebbels turned his anger upon the ""society rabble"" after announcing that five German actors had been banned from the stage for publicly rediculing Nazi party and state functionaries. He denied that there was any lack of humor in Nazi Germany, but said that it must be kept ""good-natured, decent and clean.""
""There is plenty of humor in Germany, more than enough,"" he said in a three and one-half column editorial in the Nazi party's newspaper Voelkischer Beobachter. ""But we do not permit ourselves to be ridiculed.""
The five actors were Werner Finck, actor-author; Pete Sachse, vaudeville comedian, and Helmut Buth, Wilhelm Meissner and Manfred Dlugi, the latter three members of a vaudeville combination known as ""The Three Rulands."" The five were said to have been warned repeatedly to stop making jokes about the Nazis.
""How would it be if they offered their services for building the western fortifications? Then they would learn something about the things about which they have been making jokes.""
Those who work for the state have a right to make jokes, he said, ""but others have only the right to keep their mouths shut.""
One of the best-known cabaret jokes frowned upon by the Nazi leaders originated in Munich recently. Weiss Ferdl, a comedian, approached an empty table and began disgorging watches and jewelry from his pockets. He turned to the audience with a leering remark:
""Ach, you were asleep that night,"" referring to the anti-Jewish disorders.
Another one was based on the four-power meeting at Munich last September. One comedian representing Premier Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain looked appealingly at Chancellor Adolf Hitler and said:
""Can't I have something to take back with me to London?""
Hitler replied:
""All right, I'll give you your umbrella back.""
Goebbels said comedians have no right to be jocular about such things as the Nazi four-year economic plan or Adolf Hitler's demand for colonies because they are too important and require too much careful thinking on the part of big minds.
""Such jokes make us retch,"" Goebbels said.
""Jokes about them by people who know nothing about them cannot be permitted. Things which are holy to us also are holy to the people.""
""Just imagine that a variety show existed in the Vatican City in which the sacrament or beliefs of the Catholic Church were made the subject of cabaret jokes. It is absurd to think of such a thing.""
""For some time a certain depravity and lack of discipline has become noticeable and has greatly angered a wide section of the population, particularly members of the party.""
The Government decided to stop the jokes, Goebbels said, before Nazis ""resorted to self-defense measures.""
The Propaganda Minister said that actors like the five suspended yesterday never were in the party and ""now will have no further opportunity to burden down the public with their rude remarks.""
We did not yet locate online Goebbels' ""three and one-half column editorial"" from the former Nazi Party newspaper Völkischer Beobachter. The Feb. 3 entry in Goebbels'diary(only visible when borrowed) identified the editorial as published on Jan. 30 — the same day as Hitler's Reichstagspeech, in which he told the German public and the world that the outbreak of war would mean ""the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe."" Goebbels wrote in his diary, in part, ""My piece on the 30th January appears in a prominent position in the Völkischer Beobachter. I think it works well.""
The New York Times reported asimilararticleabout the banned comedians on its front page, also on Feb. 4, including additional noteworthy information, saying Goebbels himself ended the entertainers' careers, and that their actions most amusing the public were their ""unmistakable"" caricatures including ""gestures, poses and physical characteristics of National Socialist leaders — sometimes with bon mots that made the rounds of the country.""
The final paragraph of the article read, ""If the anti-German press of Paris, London and New York, Dr. Goebbels says, or the democratic governments in Western Europe, should now again complain about the lack of freedom of opinion in Germany, it does not matter, ""for after all during the last year the Fuehrer reconquered 10,000,000 Germans for the Reich."""

"""Undocumented immigrants paid more taxes last year than Amazon, GM, IBM & Netflix combined.""",True,"Millionsof immigrants in the U.S. illegally pay taxes. But do they pay more to the government than multibillion dollar corporations such as Netflix and Amazon?

That’s what some immigration advocates argued as the Trump administration works to deliver on the president’spromiseto carry out an historic deportation operation.

""Undocumented immigrants paid more taxes last year than Amazon, GM, IBM & Netflix combined,"" Occupy Democrats, a liberal media and advocacy organization,postedJune 11 on Facebook.

Social media users shared the statement on other platforms, includingLinkedIn,ThreadsandInstagram.

But is it true?

Available numbers show that immigrants in the U.S. illegally paid more in taxes in recent years than Amazon, General Motors, IBM and Netflix combined. But there are some caveats to that, including that we don’t have estimates for what such immigrants paid in 2024.

Occupy Democrats did not respond to an email inquiry for this fact-check.

For this fact-check, we compared federal personal income taxes to federal corporate income taxes. Brian Kovak, an economics and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon, told us our approach could potentially underestimate the total tax contributions of immigrants in comparison to companies, since immigrants also pay other types of taxes.

David Kallick, director of Immigration Research Initiative, a nonpartisan think tank, said  that comparing people and corporations is not an ""apples-to-apples comparison,"" but ""it’s entirely fair"" to compare the taxes paid by people illegally in the country to the taxes paid by corporations, since both relate to federal income taxes.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally pay billions each year in taxes.

Here’s how: The IRS allows people who are not eligible for Social Security numbers, such as people who are in the U.S. illegally, to file their taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, orITIN. More than 5.8 million people had active ITINs at the end of 2022, theIRS reported.

Immigrants without lawful permission can pay all forms of taxes, including federal income tax, Social Security and state taxes.

Recent estimates vary on exactly how much they pay.

Yale University’s Budget Lab, a nonpartisan research center,estimatedin April that immigrants in the U.S. illegally paid $66 billion in payroll and federal income taxes in 2023. Payroll taxesfundprograms such as Social Security and Medicare, and income taxes pay for public services.

The American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy organization,foundthat in 2023 ""households led by undocumented immigrants"" paid approximately $89.8 billion in federal, state and local taxes.

In 2024, the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policyput the figure atmore than $96 billion in federal, state and local taxes based on 2022 numbers. Of that, the group found, about $59.4 billion went to the federal government, and $37.3 billion went to state and local taxes.

The right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reformcriticizedthe Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy’s methodology, saying it undercounted the number of U.S. people in the U.S. illegally and overcounted the number of workers in the U.S. illegally and their income.

But FAIR’s average annual income calculations for people in the United States illegally align roughly with the institute’s findings. For example, FAIR used the average income for ""unskilled jobs"" in California to estimate that people in the state illegally make $40,000 dollars a year, which lands slightly higher than the institute’s average income estimate of about $38,000 per year.

Because state and local taxes vary, we focused on federal income tax data to compare tax payments by Amazon, Netflix, IBM and GM and immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that immigrants in the U.S. illegally paid $19.5 billion in federal income taxes in 2022, and Yale’s Budget Lab estimate was $22 billion for 2023.

Looking at 2022 data, we found that Amazon, Netflix, IBM and GM together paid about $5 billion in federal income taxes:$2.2 billionby Amazon,$772 millionby Netflix,$391 millionby IBM, and$1.88billion by GM.

A 2022 federal law raised taxes on large companies, presumably increasing these companies’ 2024 federal income tax contributions. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden,includedthe Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, which imposed a 15% tax on corporations with $1 billion or more in annual profits.

The companies’ 2024 public disclosures show that, combined, these companies paid about $15 billion in federal income taxes in 2024:$9 billionby Amazon,$1.25billion by Netflix,$2.1 billionby IBM, and$2.4 billionby GM.

That’s about $4 billion less than what the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found immigrants paid in federal income taxes in 2022 and about $7 billion less than the Yale analysis said they paid in 2023.

Occupy Democrats said, ""Undocumented immigrants paid more taxes last year than Amazon, GM, IBM & Netflix combined.""

Independent think tank analyses found that in 2022 and 2023, people in the country illegally paid $66 billion to $96 billion in federal, state and local taxes. Of that amount, $19.5 billion to $22 billion was federal income taxes.

That’s higher than the combined federal income taxes paid by Amazon, GM, IBM and Netflix. Tax disclosures show they paid a combined $5 billion in 2022 and $15 billion in 2024 in federal income taxes.

“The Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington has removed” Bishop Mariann Budde “from the National Cathedral.”,False,"The Right Rev. Mariann Budde drew President Donald Trump’s ire during an inaugural prayer service when she used her Washington National Cathedral pulpit to urge him to ""have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,"" such as LGBTQ+ people and migrants.

""There are gay, lesbain and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives,"" Budde said.

Trumplater calledBudde a ""Radical Left hard line Trump hater,"" and demanded an apology.

Claims Budde was subsequently ousted as the Episocopal bishop of Washington started moving online, even though they were made up.

""The Episcopal Archdiocese of Washington has removed Bishop Mariann Budd from the National Cathedral: ‘No place for politics!’"" a Jan. 24 Threadspostsaid,misspelling Budde’s last name.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

This claim is false. Kevin Eckstrom, a Washington National Cathedral spokesperson, told PolitiFact, ""I can confirm without hesitation that Bishop Budde very much remains the Episcopal Bishop of Washington.""

Eckstrom also shared a statement from the Episcopal Church headquarters, which said: ""Buddewas elected in 2011by clergy and lay leaders of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington to serve as their 9th bishop. Shewas ordained in November of that year, and has served as a bishop in good standing since that time. She is a valued and trusted pastor to her diocese and colleague to bishops throughout our church. Westand byBishop Budde and her appeal for the Christian values of mercy and compassion.""

A Jan. 21letterfrom Episcopal Church leaders in response to the Trump administration’s immigration-related executive orders and his planned mass deportation campaign echoed Budde.

""We read this news with concern and urge our new president and congressional leaders to exercise mercy and compassion, especially toward law-abiding, long-term members of our congregations and communities; parents and children who are under threat of separation in the name of immigration enforcement; and women and children who are vulnerable to abuse in detention and who fear reporting abuse to law enforcement,"" the letter said.

This Threads post’s claim originated on the Facebook page America - Love It Or Leave It, which is a subsidiary of America’s Last Line of Defense. Christopher Blair created the account and has said hisposts are satireintended to mock conservatives. The America - Love It Or Leave It Facebook pagesays in its intro: ""Nothing on this page is real.""

Its Jan. 23post, which similarly misspelled Budde’s name, said: ""Bishop Mariann Budd has been removed from the National Cathedral by the Episocal Archdiocese of Washington.""

""Keep politics away from the pulpit,"" the post said.

“I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.”,False,"Hours after a plane crashed over the Potomac River a few miles from the White House, President Donald Trump held a press briefing in which he blamed his predecessors’ diversity hiring policies as a possible reason for the accident.

Sixty-seven people were presumed dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided in midair with a U.S. Army helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. The victims included three U.S. service members aboard the helicopter and everyone aboard the plane, including several young figure skaters, a civil rights lawyer, a newlywed, a pilot and several flight attendants.

Trump started his Jan. 30press conferencewith a moment of silence but pivoted to blame Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who Trump said led Federal Aviation Administration diversity programs that inspired the agency to hire unqualified air traffic control employees. Trump said he ended those initiatives in 2017 when he was first elected, but Biden reinstated them.

""I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy,"" Trump said. ""And then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new order, bringing it to the highest level of intelligence.""

Trump read from aFox News headlinethat said the Federal Aviation Administration diversity hiring initiative ""includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities."" Trump said it came out a week before he took office, but it was published Jan. 14, 2024. After the press conference,the White Housealso pointed to an Obama-era biographical assessment for air traffic controllers that critics said prioritized diversity over skills.

A close look at the FAA’s hiring policies under Obama, Biden and Trump shows that Trump mischaracterized the policies and misled about his actions and the actions of his White House predecessors. He also provided no evidence these policies had any connection to the fatal crash.

The crash has generated renewed concerns about air traffic controller staffing, and the cause remains under investigation. Expertswarnedagainst singling out any specific cause of the crash, including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, less than 24 hours after it occurred.

In 2010, Obama’s administration issued anexecutive orderdirecting federal agencies to hire more people with disabilities, noting that although 54 million people in the U.S. have disabilities, they were underrepresented in the federal workforce. The FAA incorporated the directive into its hiring practices.

That didn’t stop when Trump took office in 2017. Archives of the FAA’s website show the agency continually highlighted its diversity hiring initiatives, including its aims to hire people with disabilities, from 2013 up until Trump reclaimed office in 2025, includingthroughout Trump’s first term, 2017 to 2021. The page wastaken downafter Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20.

During his Jan. 30 press conference, Trump maligned a list of ""targeted disabilities,"" including severe intellectual disabilities, saying their emphasis in hiring was unique to his predecessors.

The term ""targeted disabilities"" is legallydefined acrossthe federal government to include ""hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism.""

Yet in 2019, also under Trump’s first term, the FAA launcheda programthat aimed to hire 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers, including people who have these ""targeted disabilities.""

In its April 11, 2019,press release, the agency said the program’s key focus was to ""identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce.""

After being sworn in for his second term, Trump on Jan. 20 and Jan. 22 signedexecutiveordersaimed at shutting down diversity programs in the federal government, including the FAA.

The White House confirmed Jan. 30 that Trump’s executive orders did away with those goals.

In 2014, the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers thatweighed biographical informationsuch as work and education experience and personality traits as part of a person’s application. The training standards for those who were hired didn’t change.

The assessment did not ask specifically about race, but critics said it was designed to create a more diverse hiring pool at the expense of people who were more qualified or performed better on skills tests. People who failed were not allowed to continue with their application. The FAA introduced the assessment into its hiring protocol in 2014 after itcommissioned a studyof the barriers racial minorities and women face in becoming air traffic controllers.

Throughout his first term, the Trump administration defended the Transportation Department ina lawsuitover the assessment, which plaintiffs said was discriminatory. Trump’s administration and Biden’s administration bothdeniedin court that the process favored nonwhite applicants. Nevertheless, in 2018, Trump jettisoned its use of the air control biographicalassessment, the White House said.

Biden’s administration did notreinstate the assessment, and it has not been a part of theapplication process since 2018.

All air traffic controllers need to pass skills and medical tests to be hired, air traffic management experts told PolitiFact. That didn’t change under either hiring initiative.

Some disabilities could be disqualifying, Margaret Wallace, an aviation management professor at Florida Institute of Technology, said. Some examples could include heart conditions or neurological issues that might unexpectedly incapacitate a person, or ""poor or no vision, color blindness, poor or no hearing, speech issues that could affect the ability to communicate as needed,"" Wallace said.

Michael McCormickretired from the FAAin 2015 after working under Republican and Democrat administrations, and his work included hiring controllers. He said most of the conditions Trump listed would not meet the agency’s medical standards.

""The decision to hire a controller is solely based upon aptitude testing, medical certification and security investigation,"" McCormick said.

As he speculated about the Jan. 29 air crash’s cause, Trump said ""I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.""

The White House said he was referring to two separate policies.

The first was a push to hire more people with disabilities that started under Obama. Trump didn’t end the initiative — he expanded the effort by announcing a program aimed at hiring 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers. All air traffic controllers had to pass medical, security and skills tests, regardless of any disability.

The second involved an Obama-era hiring assessment that critics said prioritized diversity over qualifications. Trump was wrong to say that Biden reinstated it — he did not. The assessment has not been in place since 2018, when Trump ended it. But even under that practice, training standards did not change.

Trump conflated policies, obfuscated about his role in them and misled about what they did.

Investigators are still piecing together what led to the crash, a process that could take months. Trump’s leap to connect these policies to what unfolded over the Potomac has no basis.

"The solemn U.S. military bugle call ""Taps"" originated with a Union Army father finding the melody written on paper in the pocket of his deceased Confederate soldier son.",False,"An old copied-and-pasted rumor, primarily circulating for years on Facebook, appeared prominently yet again in August 2025. The rumor claimed the famous ""Taps"" bugle call — a solemn melody played at U.S. military funerals and memorials and to signal the end of the dayin remembranceof service members who died in the line of duty — originated in 1862 from the pocket of a deceased Confederate Army soldier fighting in the Civil War.
According to the tale, a Union Army captain namedRobert Elli (""Ellicombe"" in some retellings) discovered the melody for ""Taps"" on a piece of paper found in the pocket of his deceased son who, unbeknownst to him, had enlisted to fight for the Confederacy after moving to the South to study music. Snopes received reader searches asking for the truth regarding this matter.
For example, on Aug. 8, a Facebook user shared thecopypastarumor in apost(archived) receiving over 118,000 shares, as of this writing. The post began with the question, ""I never knew ... DID YOU?""OtherFacebookuserssharedtherumoras well. The posts also featured alleged lyrics for ""Taps,"" reading in part, ""Day is done. Gone the sun. From the lakes. From the hills. From the sky. All is well. Safely rest. God is nigh.""
(Paul W. Badding/Facebook)
However, searches of the literary and newspaper archives hosted byGoogle BooksandNewspapers.comlocated no credible records confirming this tale as the ""Taps"" origin story. Rather, we firstreportedon this fabricated story as a false rumor in 2008. Further searches located no official lyrics for ""Taps."" Even so, Newspapers.com hosts some old articles pairing the Facebook posts' ""Day is done"" lyrics with the tune as far back asat least 1916.
A popular Facebookpost(archived) from 2014, to date receiving over 837,000 shares, also helped to popularize the rumor on the social media platform.The full text for the made-up origin story appears later in this article.
Jari Villanueva, a former bugler at Arlington National Cemetery with the U.S. Air Force Band — and a man the Department of Veteran Affairsdubbedas a ""'Taps' historian"" — toldUSA Todayin 2020 that the fabricated father-son story originated during a 1949 episode of cartoonist Robert L. Ripley's short-lived TV show, ""Ripley's Believe it or Not."" On May 28, 1949,The Atlanta Journalreported Ripley's death at age 55. The article featured a mention of the ""Taps"" episode, airing only days prior to his passing, but did not describe the fabricated story.
In a document published by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Villaneuvadescribedthe tale of the Union Army father and Confederate Army son as a ""popular myth."" Even so, he said the genuine ""Taps"" origin story still involved the Civil War:
Of all the military bugle calls, none is so easily recognized or more apt to evoke emotion than ""Taps."" The melody is both eloquent and haunting and the history of its origin is interesting and somewhat clouded in controversy and myth.
The use of ""Taps"" is unique to the United States military, as the call is sounded at funerals, wreath-laying ceremonies and memorial services. ""Taps"" originally began as a signal to extinguish lights. Up until the Civil War, the infantry call for ""Extinguish Lights"" was the one set down in the Infantry manuals which had been borrowed from the French. The music for ""Taps"" was changed by Major General Daniel Adams Butterfield for his brigade in July, 1862. Butterfield was not pleased with the call for ""Extinguish Lights"" feeling that it was too formal to signal the day's end. With the help of the brigade bugler, Oliver Willcox Norton, he created ""Taps"" to honor his men while in camp at Harrison's Landing, Virginia following the Seven Days' battles during the Peninsular Campaign.
Butterfield did not compose ""Taps"" but actually revised an earlier bugle call. The call we know today as ""Taps"" existed in an early version of the call ""Tattoo"" which had gone out of use by the Civil War. Butterfield knew this early call from his days before the war as a colonel in the 12th New York Militia. As a signal at the end of the day, armies have used ""Tattoo"" to alert troops to prepare for the evening roll call. Butterfield took the last 5 and a half measures of the ""Tattoo"" and revised them into the 24 notes we know today. The new call soon spread to other units of the Union Army.
Oliver Willcox Norton wrote about the experience later in his life:""During the early part of the Civil War I was bugler at the Headquarters of Butterfield's Brigade,... One day, soon after the seven days' battles on the Peninsular, when the Army of the Potomac was lying in camp at Harrison's Landing, General Daniel Butterfield sent for me, and showing me some notes on a staff written in pencil on the back of an envelope, asked me to sound them on my bugle. I did this several times, playing the music as written. He changed it somewhat, lengthening some notes and shortening others, but retaining the melody as he first gave it to me. After getting it to his satisfaction, he directed me to sound that call for ""Taps"" thereafter in place of the regulation call. The music was beautiful on that still summer night, and was heard far beyond the limits of our Brigade. The next day I was visited by several buglers from neighboring brigades, asking for copies of the music which I gladly furnished. I think no general order was issued from army headquarters authorizing the substitution of this for the regulation call, but as each brigade commander exercised his own discretion in such minor matters, the call was gradually taken up through the Army of the Potomac.""
Villanueva further noted the potential ties between the word ""Taps"" and ""Tattoo,"" or ""Taptoe,"" but said, ""More than likely, 'Taps' comes from the three drum taps that were beat as a signal for 'Extinguish Lights' when a bugle was not used."" He hosts more information about his work ontapsbugler.com.

"Construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s $200 million White House ballroom expansion is continuing as planned despite the government shutdown that began on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",True,"The ballroom construction was reported to be funded by the president and private donors rather than taxpayer funds.
As the U.S. government entered ashutdownon Oct. 1, 2025, due to partisan budget battles, accusations of blame for which party was responsible flung across the aisles of Congress. Social media users also chimed in on the shutdown, many frustrated by theservicesand jobs that could be lost as a result of politicians being unable to reach a compromise.
One popular rumor alleged that U.S. President's Donald Trump's pet project to construct a massive extension of the White House ballroom — previouslyannouncedat a cost of $200 million — would continue as planned despite the shutdown. Construction on the ballroom began in September 2025.
Users on social media platforms likeX(archived),Facebook(archived) andInstagram(archived) shared the purported rumor, most of which spread anX post(archived) from independent journalist Brian Tyler Cohen.
Cohen linked to a report byABC Newsand wrote, ""The White House just announced that the construction of Trump's $200 million golden ballroom will continue during the government shutdown while American soldiers go without pay.""
Cohen's post also included a rendering of the proposed ballroom, as shown in the White House's announcement of the project, and a photo of soldiers marching:

— No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen (@NoLieWithBTC)October 1, 2025
The claim that construction was continuing on Trump's White House ballroom project was true.
A White House official told Snopes in an email, ""Ballroom construction is continuing as it is financed by private donations, not the federal appropriations that Democrats are holding up to push free health care for illegal immigrants.""
The second part of the official's statement referred to the Republican narrative that Democrats were to be held responsible for the government shutdown in order to fund health care for ""illegal aliens,"" a claim Snopes previouslyinvestigatedand found false.
However, it did appear that the ballroom expansion was funded by Trump and private donors, according to aprevious Snopes investigationof the project, so its continuation tracks with previous statements made by the administration.
The part of the rumor alleging ""American soldiers will go without pay"" is accurate, according toCongress.
Service members are paid through the budget of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice. According to Congress, as of Sept. 30, 2025, ""No appropriations are in place to fund pay and allowances of active and reserve component members into FY2026.""
However, there are some exceptions to this, which Snopespreviously broke downin December 2024 during a different wave of government shutdown threats.
Cohen's post about the ballroom construction seemed to imply continuing construction would directly impact the pay for soldiers, which was misleading.

"Warner Bros' animated ""Looney Tunes"" series used to be called ""Looney Toons,"" a reference to the fact that they're cartoons.",False,"For years, many people have sworn that ""Looney Tunes,"" the iconic Warner Bros animated cartoon series, was once spelled ""Looney Toons."" In summer 2025 alone, multiple popularposts(archived) onInstagram(archived) made the claim. Older posts making the same claim have also spread widely onTikTok(archived),YouTube(archived),Reddit(archived) andFacebook(archived).
The reason for this discrepancy in spelling, people on social media have claimed, is theMandela Effect, a term Snopes has defined as ""a collective misremembering of a fact or event.""
In replies to some of the social media posts, people claimed the ""Looney Toons"" spelling simply made more sense because the animated shorts were cartoons.
Contrary to the claims, however, the animated Warner Bros cartoon series has always used the ""tunes"" spelling in its title — never ""toons.""
TheInternet Archivehas a record of ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Merrie Melodies"" episodes beginning with the very first from 1930. Although both began in black-and-white, during much of the franchise's first decade ""Looney Tunes"" was for cartoons in black-and-white while ""Merrie Melodies"" were in color. Later, when every new episode in the series was in color, the titles were used interchangeably.
The very first episode from 1930, ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub,"" begins with a title card that reads ""Looney Tunes."" In 1937's ""Porky's Duck Hunt,"" the first episode in which Daffy Duck appeared, the black-and-white title card reads ""Looney Tunes."" In the first episode to feature the rabbit who became Bugs Bunny, 1938's ""Porky's Hare Hunt,"" the title card again reads ""Looney Tunes.""
When ""Looney Tunes"" beganappearing in color in 1943, the title cards still used the ""tunes"" spelling. The franchise was still called ""Looney Tunes"" in the1950s, as well as the1960s. The title card reads ""Looney Tunes"" in the most recent short on the Internet Archive's record, ""Box Office Bunny,"" which aired in theaters in 1991.
Although the term ""animated cartoons"" already existed at the time, ""Looney Tunes"" was never meant to be a reference to cartoons. Instead, ""Looney Tunes,"" as well as the synonymous ""Merrie Melodies,"" was a paraphrase of Disney's ""Silly Symphonies,"" a series of cartoons Disney released between 1929 and 1939, according to Leonard Maltin in his 1987 book ""Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons."" Each episode of ""Silly Symphonies"" was based on musical themes, which was the reason for the musical title. The same was the case for ""Looney Tunes"" at its inception, as Warner Bros. had its music publishing company at the time.
While it is possible that an episode or dub could have aired with a typo that read ""Looney Toons,"" or there could have been promotional material with the same typo, the franchise's official title has always been ""Looney Tunes."""
"Turning Point USA CEO and co-founder Charlie Kirk said about civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.: ""MLK was awful.

On Sept. 10, 2025, Turning Point USA co-founder and conservative commentator Charlie Kirk wasfatally shotduring a Utah college speaking event.
In the aftermath, social media users shared a quote in which the conservative pundit reportedly said civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't a good person. Posts onFacebook,Instagram,and Xattributed the following words to Kirk: ""MLK was awful. He's not a good person. He said one good thing he actually didn't believe."" Snopes also received reader queries about the authenticity of the alleged quote.
(Instagram user @etanthomas36)
We found that the quote about King was correctly attributed to Kirk.
Journalist William Turton first reported on Kirk's comments in a January 2024 article forWired(archived). According to Turton's report, Kirk made the statement while speaking at America Fest, a political convention organized by Turning Point USA, in December 2023.
Kirk wasrespondingto a question from a student who said he was the subject of a Title IX investigation at his university after posting a derogatory message about transgender people on social media. Kirk noted how the student had been kicked out of school under the Title IX complaint.
Turton, who attended the event, provided an audio recording to Snopes, which verified that Kirk said:
[The student] got kicked out of school under a Title IX complaint, using the Civil Rights Act, that we as conservatives worship. ""Oh, MLK's a great guy.""Actually MLK was awful. OK? He's not a good person. He said one good thing he actually didn't believe. [unintelligible] Go research MLK, you should go research him.
Kirk claimed the federal government was coming after students' free speech ""using the mid-1960s Civil Rights Act that was passed with good intentions"" as now a permanent diversity, equity and inclusion-type bureaucracy.
During the same event, Kirksaid, ""I have a very, very radical view on this, but I can defend it, and I've thought about it. We made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the mid-1960s.""
Kirk was referring tothe landmark federal lawbanning discrimination in public places, which provided for the integration of schools and other public spaces and made employment discrimination illegal. Title IX, which ""prohibitsdiscrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance,"" was not part of the original 1964 Civil Rights Act butpassedunder the Education Amendments of 1972
Kirk responded to theWiredarticle about his characterization of King during an episode of his podcast, ""The Charlie Kirk Show."" A clip of his response can be found onRumble, where he reads aloud excerpts from an email sent by the Wired reporter:
""We note in our piece that Kirk describes King as, quote, 'A bad guy.'"" That's true.""And Kirk described a 'very, very radical view' that the country made a mistake when it passed the Civil Rights Act."" Also true. ""As we note in the piece, Kirk has previously described [King] as a hero and a civil rights icon."" That's true, I used to be wrong. ""What inspired Kirk to shift his view on MLK? Why does Kirk think MLK is a bad guy?""
As we've reportedpreviously, Kirk made negative remarks about the Civil Rights Act outside of the Turning Point USA event. For example, in April 2024, Media Matters for Americapublished(archived) a video and accompanying transcript in which Kirk said the Civil Rights Act ""created a beast, and that beast has now turned into an anti-white weapon."" That footage appeared in avideoon Kirk's channel on Rumble (at 8:06).

In the first 15 seconds of the video, a male officer tells a Black woman sitting outside with a coffee cup, ""You need to leave. Now."" The woman responds, ""What? I'm just having coffee."" He replies, ""Manager says you're making people uncomfortable. You're trespassing."" She then explains she purchased coffee at the location and shows a badge, identifying herself as a special agent with the FBI.
For the remaining 23 minutes, the video shows the same still images of the scene with a narrator telling a lengthy story. The narrator identifies the pair as Seattle police Officer Craig Bartlett and 16-year FBI veteran Jennifer Monroe. The narrator also says the interaction occurred at a coffee shop in downtown Seattle.
In short, the video was fake and created with artificial intelligence. Searches ofBing,DuckDuckGo,GoogleandYahoofound no news media outlets reporting any news of a Seattle police officer harassing a Black FBI agent, nor did other searches find news of a ""Craig Bartlett"" interacting with ""Jennifer Monroe.""
Bodycam Justice Files, the YouTubechannelreferenced in the Facebook post caption, hosted the same inauthenticvideo(archived) from Nov. 8. The text description falsely claimed the incident sparked ""national outrage, a $6 million lawsuit and major police reforms,"" and called it ""a true story of bias, accountability and justice."" The YouTube video's thumbnail image displayed the quotes ""I look suspicious?"" and ""Say that again.""
Snopes contacted the Bowmayladastory Facebook page owner via Messenger to ask about their inauthentic content, as well as whether anyone pays them to post the fake videos. The Bodycam Justice Files YouTube channel did not display any email addresses or other means of external communication.
The inauthentic video alleging to show a ""racist cop"" kicking a Black FBI agent out of a coffee shop displayed several signs of being generated with AI.
For example, the opening clip with dialogue lasted exactly 15 seconds, indicating the user who first posted the video used an AI tool with a maximum creation length of 15 seconds.
The fast, forceful and loud manner of speaking between the officer and woman resembled the same speaking patterns existing in AI-generated videos in late 2025.
The video's narrator explained the incident occurred in downtown Seattle, yet no tall buildings were visible in the clip.
The woman displayed her badge in an unnatural-seeming manner by showing the badge to the officer about five seconds before verbally identifying herself as a special agent with the FBI.
The Bodycam Justice Files YouTube channel and video's text description both displayed disclaimers, though neither disclaimer explicitly identified the content as AI-generated. The disclaimer under the video read:
This video is for educational and documentary purposes only. All footage and information shown are from credible public sources. We do not support or promote violence, discrimination, harassment, or illegal behavior.

A video of a wormhole-esque formation of clouds shared to social media in October 2025 was authentic footage of Hurricane Melissa ahead of its landfall in Jamaica.,False,"On Oct. 28, 2025, Hurricane Melissa struck the island of Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph winds, making it the strongest storm to ever directly hit the island and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever at the time of landfall.
Ahead of that landfall, people on social media shared clips demonstrating how well-organized the storm was, a characteristic most pronounced in strong hurricanes. Some of these clips came in the form of a video that appeared to be shot from out the window of a passenger plane above Hurricane Melissa's clouds. The clouds in that video spun in the shapeof whatone person(archived) described as a ""wormhole.""
The video was widely shared to multiple social media sites, such asX(archived),Instagram(archived),TikTok(archived) andFacebook(archived).
The video was not real footage of Hurricane Melissa. It was generated by artificial intelligence (AI).
On Oct. 25, 2025, the TikTok account @earthimpactsposted the video(archived), making it the earliest post with the video Snopes could find through a reverse image search. Earth impacts' video carried TikTok's ""AI-generated"" content label and was captioned with the hashtag ""#ai.""
Earth impacts' profilebio read ""AI disaster curiosity."" The account has regularly uploaded AI-generated videos of various disasters, including hurricanes.
The fact that the video was from a passenger plane above the clouds was itself an indication that the video wasn't authentic.
The clouds of a hurricane can be anywhere from about30,000 feet highto50,000 feet high, according to the United Kingdom's Meteorological Office and U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Hurricane hunters, who fly through the eyes of hurricanes to collect data on them, typically fly into storms at analtitude of about 10,000 feet, the U.S. Air Force wrote in October 2024. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) keeps anarchiveof hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight logs. While many of these flights remained at around 10,000 feet or lower altitudes, Snopes foundone logof a flight into Hurricane Melissa that was between12,000 feet and 20,000 feet.
A commercial passenger aircraft typically flies at a cruising altitude between 30,000 and 42,000 feet,Leopard Aviation Flight Schoolwrote on its website. Even if such an aircraft was flying at the highest end of that range and the clouds of Hurricane Melissa were at the lowest end of its range, a passenger plane would still avoid the hurricane entirely. Public flight radar data from the24 hours before Hurricane Melissa's landfallshowed commercial airlines clearly avoiding Jamaica and the area around Hurricane Melissa. The few planes that entered the storm's area of the ocean were hurricane hunter planes.
Hurricane hunters with the U.S. Air Force have posted tosocial mediareal videosof flights through Hurricane Melissa's eye. Those clips, while still dramatic, showed the hurricane hunters flew through the storm's clouds to reach the eye. Plane parts visible in the videos show propellors consistent with the types of planes used for hurricane hunting, not passenger planes."
Two videos posted online in fall 2025 showed authentic TV news reports about U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George issuing a statement on live television declaring President Donald Trump a direct threat to national security and calling for him to be immediately removed from office.,False,"In fall 2025, two videos circulated online purportedly showing authentic TV news reports about U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George issuing a statement on live television declaring President Donald Trump a direct threat to national security and calling for him to be immediately removed from office.
A Facebookpage(archived) called Newsinforium posted onevideo(archived) on Sept. 26, which featured authentic yet unrelated clips. Another Facebook page named The Microphone Mediahosted(archived) the second, more popular version of the alleged news report. The latter, from Sept. 27, appeared to feature a news anchor reading the report.
Other social mediauserssharedthe videos elsewhere onFacebookand onTikTok, while Snopes readers also contacted us asking whether George made such remarks.
Though the transcripts of the alleged reports varied slightly in their wording, both narrators made similar claims. For example, The Microphone Media's video transcript read as follows:
Trump may have finally crossed the point of no return. And this time, the hit didn't come from Congress or a political opponent. It came from within the U.S. military itself. In a move no one saw coming, Gen. Randy A. George, chief of staff of the Army, went live on national television and issued a statement that sent shockwaves across the country.
He declared that the president is not just a fading political figure, but an immediate and dangerous threat to America's national security and the stability of its core institutions.
According to the general, Trump funneled shady defense contracts to billionaire allies, drained critical resources away from the armed forces and left soldiers struggling without even the basics they need. Even more alarming, he accused him of breaking federal law, colluding with foreign governments and leaking highly classified military strategies.
And then came the words that shook Washington to its foundation. ""This man must be removed from office immediately."" To make matters even more serious, the general confirmed that all the evidence is already secured in the hands of the FBI. This is only the beginning of a story that could change the course of American history.
In short, the news reports were fake and displayed numerous signs of being generated using artificial-intelligence software, as outlined below.
By email, Army spokesperson Col. Marty Meiners confirmed to Snopes, ""That is obviously a fake AI video.""
The Microphone Media'svideodisplayed multiple standardsignsof AI-generated content. For example, it featured fake images of George, showing him with a overly smooth skin. At the 0:22 mark, a horizontally-mirrored picture showed the general with a name badge reading, ""U.6C,"" while at the 0:34 mark, the badge read, ""CAICD.""
Other telltale signs the images were AI-generated included the camera operators, some with warped faces, all facing different directions at 0:09, incomprehensible subtitles on a TV screen at 0:21 and a police car emblazoned with ""Americca Police"" at 1:01.
Both fake reports also included AI-generated narrator voices. For example, The Microphone Media's video used an AI voice named ""Brian"" from the ElevenLabs text-to-speechwebsite. Newsinforium's video, meanwhile, contained a passage, from 0:48, that did not make sense: ""George said even more alarming the general claimed there is evidence that Trump has broke, br, broken the law …""
Searches ofBing,DuckDuckGo,GoogleandYahoouncovered no examples of news media outlets reporting on the comments attributed to George. Had a U.S. military leader taken to national TV to speak out against Trump, outlets worldwide would have reported on the matter. In addition, neither of the supposed newscasts displayed any branding or network affiliation.

"In October 2025, the entire White House East Wing was demolished as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a new ballroom.",True,"In late October 2025, rumors spread online that the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a new ballroom.
The claims circulated after Trumpvowedin July 2025 his new project would not ""interfere with the current building."" Referring to that statement,one X user claimed on Oct. 20 that ""Trump lied"" and ""destroyed"" the East Wing for the ballroom (archived):
DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST DESTROYED PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
TRUMP PROMISED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS RIDICULOUS BALLROOM WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE EXISTING STRUCTURE, IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS JUST ANOTHER TRUMP LIE. TRUMP AND HIS ACTIONS ARE A NATIONAL DISGRACE.
IT IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE DONALD, NOT YOURS!
High-profile critics of Trump spread the rumor. For instance, MSNBC host Rachel Maddowposted on Bluesky(archived) quotes and a link to aWashington Post articleabout the reported demolition, with the caption ""omg!"" Also, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said of the alleged construction onBluesky(archived), ""It's not his house. It's your house. And he's destroying it.""
The claim that the entire White House East Wing was demolished in late October 2025 was true.
On Oct. 22, 2025, Trumptold reportersin the Oval Officethat construction crews would tear down the entire East Wing for his ballroom project, which he said would cost him and a group of private donors $300 million.""In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,"" Trump said, as he held up renderings of the planned ballroom.
The following day, photos from reputable sources, such asThe Associated Press, confirmed the East Wing was gone, including theEast Colonnade, a long hallway that connected the Residence (the central building of the White House) with the East Wing.
The Washington Post first reported on the East Wing's teardown with an articleon Oct. 20. Later in the day,severalreputablenewsoutletsconfirmed that the demolition project had begun. At that point, it wasnot clearhow much of the existing buildingwould go down.
As the week advanced, more photographs of the construction project surfaced. By Oct. 21, most of the building was gone, leaving a narrow band of the north and western façades.
One photo, taken from the building of the Treasury Department, which has the most direct view of the East Wing, showed the demolition. Chris Geidner, who reports on legal matters, posted the photo on his website,Law Dork, without citing a source as Treasury employees werereportedly bannedfrom taking and sharing photographs of the site:
(Law Dork)
On Oct. 23, the demolition crew finished the teardown of both the East Wing and the East Colonnade, as severalreputablenews sourcesreported.
Trump said the ballroom would cost $300 million, up from a $200 million price tag heannounced in July 2025. The Associated Pressreportedthat it would be nearly twice the size of the White House.
Construction crews built the East Wing in 1902 when Theodore Roosevelt was president. Officials expanded the building in 1942, under former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to cover the bunker he used during World War II (now thePresidential Emergency Operations Center).
The East Wing later housed theoffices of the first lady, her staff and the White House social secretary. It also served as the visitors' entrance for tours of the presidential residence. The White House'smovie theaterused to be inside the East Colonnade."
“Stacey Abrams stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers.”,False,"Stacey Abrams, the two-time Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, did not steal $2 billion from a clean energy grant program, despite social media claims.

""Stacey Abrams stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers,"" one Feb. 19Facebook postsaid.

Other social media posts circulated a similar claim, including the conservative X account Libs of TikTok, whichaccusedthe funding of being a ""scam.""

The Facebook post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

The claim stems from a $2 billion Environmental Protection Agencygrantthat went to Power Forward Communities, a coalition of clean energy groups, including one in which Abrams previously was a senior counsel. The grant, which the EPAawardedunder then-President Joe Biden, will fund energy efficient housing projects around the country. There’s no evidence Abrams directly received any of the grant money or engaged in illegal behavior.

Power Forward Communities consists of Rewiring America, Enterprise Community Partners, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, United Way, and Habitat for Humanity International. The groupformed in 2023to apply for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy funding.

Abrams, an attorney, joinedRewiring America, one of the coalition’s members, in March 2023 as a senior counsel. Abrams did not have a role at Power Forward Communities beyond her position at Rewiring America, her spokesperson Joshua Karp said. She left Rewiring America at the end of 2024.

In October 2023, shortly after Rewiring America announced Power Forward Communities’ creation, Abrams said in anX postshe was ""Thrilled to be part of (Rewiring America) and the Power Forward Communities coalition.""

Power Forward Communities and Rewiring America declined to comment on the record. Power Forward Communities CEO Tim Mayopoulostold PoliticoAbrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities.

""Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant,"" Mayopoulos said in the Feb. 24 Politico article. ""It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant. Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she’s one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.""

The $2 billion grant to Power Forward Communities was part of $20 billion in funding the EPA announced in April 2024. The funding came from the National Clean Investment Fund, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Actpassedin 2022 by congressional Democrats.

An April 4, 2024,releaseabout Power Forward Communities’ award said the coalition’s members would draw on their experience ""to build and lead a national financing program providing customized and affordable solutions for single-family and multi-family housing owners and developers.""

Power Forward Communities was one of three groups chosen for awards under the National Clean Investment Fund after a competitive review process, the EPA said at the time, that included reviews from dozens of federal employees and scoring of applications by expert review panels. The EPAadvertised the planfor the program that funded Power Forward Communities in 2023, indicating it intended to choose two or three national nonprofits to partner with local organizations to deliver the funding. The grant opportunity opened inJuly 2023, and it received five applications,E&E Newsreported.

President Donald Trump’s EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hascriticized the processthat Biden’s EPA used to fund the projects, saying in a recent video that it was ""purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight."" The EPA under Trump is trying to claw back the funding that has been awarded. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

Power Forward Communitiesannounced Feb. 24it is beginning work on projects representing $539 million in EPA grant funds. They include energy efficiency upgrades in Clinton, Iowa, a new apartment complex in Detroit, Michigan, and home renovations in Salem, Massachusetts.

A Facebook post said Stacey Abrams ""stole $2 BILLION from taxpayers.""

There’s no evidence for that.

Abrams was senior counsel to one of the five member organizations of a clean energy coalition that received $2 billion in funding from Biden’s EPA. Abrams was not paid by Power Forward Communities and did not receive any of the federal funds, its CEO said.

The EPA said it awarded the grant through a competitive review process. There’s no evidence the funding was fraudulent or that Abrams personally benefited from it. Power Forward Communities recently announced the first phase of projects funded by the grant.

We rate the claim False."
"Country music icon Willie Nelson memorialized slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk in a song titled ""Let's Make Heaven Crowded.""",False,"A rumor that circulated online in October 2025 claimed country music icon Willie Nelson memorializedslainconservative activist Charlie Kirk in a song titled ""Let's Make Heaven Crowded."" Snopes received reader emails and searches about this matter. One user messaged, ""Did Willie Nelson actually write a song memorializing Charlie Kirk?""
On Oct. 1, a user managing a Facebookpagenamed The Best Of Retro Musicposted(archived) an collage with a photo of Kirk and an image of Nelson seemingly deep in thought while writing a song.

The post read, in part:
At 92, Willie Nelson unveils a powerful new song inspired by Charlie Kirk's phrase, ""Let's Make Heaven Crowded."" Though released quietly, the response has been overwhelming — fans worldwide describe it as chilling, unforgettable, and unlike anything they've heard before. With praise flooding in and calls for an official release growing louder, Nelson's heartfelt tribute is already being hailed as one of his most moving works in decades.
[…]
With his weathered voice carrying both faith and sorrow, Willie Nelson poured his heart into ""Let's Make Heaven Crowded,"" transforming Charlie Kirk's words into an anthem of hope.
""It's about love, it's about eternity,"" Nelson shared softly.
Fans have called it one of the most hauntingly beautiful tributes of his career, proving that even at 92, Willie's music still speaks with unmatched truth and timeless grace.

(The Yahoo search produced an artificial intelligence-generatedanswerabove results falsely claiming, ""Willie Nelson and Charlie Kirk collaborated on a song titled 'The Last Cowboy.'"")
Whoever authored the rumor fabricated the claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. They aimed to earn ad revenue on the websites linked from the aforementioned Facebook posts.
The aforementioned searches located a genuine song from country singer-songwriter Cole Swindell titled, ""Make Heaven Crowded."" Swindellreleasedthesongin Kirk's memory, in the weeks following his shooting death on Sept. 10.
Snopes contacted a Nelson representative to obtain official confirmation of the falsehood, as well as a page manager for The Best of Retro Music to confirm their page's monetary purpose, and will update this story if we receive further information.
An examination of the Facebook page The Best of Retro Music found multiple indications of AI-generated images, as well as other false rumors. For example, the writers of other posts misleadingly claimed country starsGeorge Strait(archived) andDolly Parton(archived) paid tribute to Kirk. Thosee posts' images — like the one of Nelson — visibly showed an overly-smooth appearance on the singers' skin — one of many modern-daysignsof AI-generated images.
Thebiofor The Best of Retro Music's Facebook page displayed its owners' location as Phoenix, while its ""page transparency""tabshowed only five page managers residing in Vietnam.
The article shared in the Facebook post for The Best of Retro Music also exhibited signs of AI generation. For example, the story ended on a forward-thinking, inspirational note — a hallmark of modern-day AI writing. That ending read:
As the world waits, one thing is clear:Willie Nelsonhas once again bridged the gap between music and meaning. By takingCharlie Kirk'sphrase and giving it voice, he has crafted not just a song but a legacy—something that will live on long after the final note fades.
It is not simply music. It is a message. A reminder that in life's brevity, what endures is love, compassion, and the shared hope of making heaven, indeed, crowded.
Further, the aforementionedYouTube videoallegedly featuring the Nelson song ""Let's Make Heaven Crowded"" displayed a text description from a user, reading in part, ""Original lyrics by me. Voice and music were made using AI.""
A Facebook search located other false posts from days following Kirk's shooting, which either misleadingly alleged Nelsonmemorialized or otherwise paid tribute toKirk, orattacked himby saying, ""If you want people to have kind words when you pass, you should say kind words when you're alive."" Those false posts also featured AI-generated content, as well as links leading to ad-filled articles on external websites.

Late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert announced a wildlife rescue program for endangered elephants in late August 2025.,False,"A rumor that circulated online in August and early September 2025 claimed Stephen Colbert, the host of CBS' ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" announced he was funding a wildlife rescue program for endangered elephants. According to the story, Colbert himself helped to guide one of the first rescued elephants to freedom. Snopes readers searched this website to find out if the rumor was true.
This rumor appeared innumerous Facebook posts. For example, on Aug. 31, a userposted(archived) the story in the Facebook group National Geographic. (The page displayed no credible affiliation to the official National Geographic publication.) The post featured photos of Colbert, including one seemingly showing him with a circus elephant. The story began, ""GOOD NEWS: Stephen Colbert just stunned fans with an announcement few saw coming — he's funding a massive wildlife rescue program dedicated to saving endangered elephants.""
(A Facebook user posted the above image on a Facebook group named after, but not affiliated with, the official National Geographic publication.)
Days earlier, an Aug. 27 Facebookpost(archived) on the page Angel Dog featured a longer version of the same story with the same pictures, as well as a link in the top comment leading to an advertisement-filledarticlehosted by the WordPress blog news.clubofsocial.com. The story began:
GOOD NEWS: Stephen Colbert just stunned fans with an announcement few saw coming — he's funding a massive wildlife rescue program dedicated to saving endangered elephants. 🐘
Instead of simply cutting a check, Colbert personally joined conservationists on-site, helping guide one of the first rescued elephants back into its natural habitat. Witnesses said the scene was unforgettable: the giant animal hesitated for a moment, then took its first free steps — while Colbert stood in silence, tears in his eyes.
When the video of that release hit the internet, it went instantly viral. Millions of viewers around the world called it one of the most powerful acts of compassion they had ever seen. And Colbert's emotional words afterward — about why he chose elephants and what this project really means — are sparking a global conversation today … 👇
However, searches ofBing,DuckDuckGo,GoogleandYahoofound no search results from news media outlets reporting about Colbert rescuing elephants. Prominent news media outlets would have widely reported this rumor, if true, especially considering the fact that CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global,announcedin July thecancellationof Colbert's show, which is scheduled to end in May 2026. (The Yahoo search produced anAI-generated answerpresenting unfounded information about Colbert's alleged support of the large Elephant Sanctuary located in Hohenwald, Tennessee. By email, a spokesperson for Elephant Sanctuary said they did not see Colbert's name listed in their system of past donors but also added the possibility of an anonymous donation.)
Rather, the person or people who authored the story fabricated the entire tale as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted famous people and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. They aimed to earn advertising revenue on one or more WordPress blogs linked from Facebook posts. The story about Colbert and elephants amounted to fiction.
An examination of the Angel Dog page's stories found multiple indications of artificial intelligence-generated (AI) images and text, including fabricated stories and fake pictures showing him helping homeless people, providing care in nursing homes and giving cash to victims of the July 2025 Texasflash floods.
Regarding the rumor at hand, a user generated the picture of Colbert and the elephant with an AI tool. That image showed Colbert wearing one of his late-night TV show suits to visit an elephant in a circus tent, with an unnatural facial expression on Colbert's face and a very smooth and shiny finish on the entire picture — one of the more tellingsignsof AI-created images.
The Angel Dog Facebook page displayed a mailing address for Galveston, Texas. However, Facebook's ""Page transparency""tabshowed the page's two managers resided in Vietnam. We previouslyreportedon the prevalence of other Vietnam-managed Facebook pages in our investigation of a wave of fabricated stories and fake images about famous people allegedly providing their money and rescue efforts that appeared on the social media platform following the Texas floods, part of a larger trend of low-quality, AI-generated content often referred to as ""AI slop.""

"California has lower homicide rates than Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma.",True,"As protesters in Los Angeles denounced President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policies — sometimes leading to clashes with law enforcement — Republican and Democratic politicians sparred over who has the bigger crime problem: blue states or red states.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, took to X to challenge three elected Republican officials who had offered posts critical of California and Newsom’s handling of the protests.

On June 9, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.,saidthat Los Angeles ""looks like a third world country — anarchists are in charge, law enforcement is being attacked, and the rule of law is nonexistent.""Later that day, Newsomposted, ""Alabama has 3X the homicide rate of California. Its murder rate is ranked third in the entire country.""

On June 10, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.,posted, ""America is sick of illegal immigration and weak, lawless liberal leadership."" He called it ""rich"" that Newsom was suing Trump to reverse the president’s federalization of California’s National Guard troops.Later that day, Newsomposted, ""If you want to discuss violence, let’s start with your state’s murder rate — which is 40% higher than California’s.""

On June 10, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican,posted, ""What’s happening in California would never happen here in Arkansas because we value order over chaos.""The next day, Newsomresponded, ""Your homicide rate is literally DOUBLE California’s.""

Newsom’s comparisons are close to accurate, because he worded his assertions carefully to refer to the homicide rate. California has more homicides than any state, but it also has by far the largest population, and using the rate — which refers to homicides per 100,000 population — makes it possible to compare states on an even footing.

Some Newsom criticsrepliedto his post by arguing that the numbers the governor used are unreliable because California has some of the lowest rates of reporting crimes to the FBI’s data collectors.

But this argument is a red herring: Newsom’s political office confirmed to PolitiFact that his data comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means it’s not subject to concerns about low reporting rates (a problem that commentatorshave exaggerated).

California fares less well against these three states when measuring overall violent crime, which includes homicides, rapes, aggravated assaults and robberies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishesdatashowing the number of homicides per state, as well as the rate of homicides per 100,000 population. The latter metric allows a comparison of bigger states to smaller states.

According to 2022 data, the latest available, Alabama ranks third in the nation for homicide rate, with 14.9 per 100,000 population. (It trails Mississippi and Louisiana, and also the District of Columbia, which generally isn’t considered comparable to the 50 states because it’s effectively a city rather than a state.)

Arkansas ranks sixth with a rate of 11.8 per 100,000. Oklahoma ranks 20th, with a rate of 8.3 per 100,000.

And California? It ranks 30th, with a rate of 5.9 per 100,000.

Alabama’s rate is about 2.5 times California’s rate; Newsom said it was triple. Oklahoma’s rate is 41% higher than California’s; Newsom said it was 40% higher. And Arkansas’ rate doubles California’s, which is what Newsom said.

""The CDC data are very reliable when it comes to death and mortality data because these come directly from coroners records and state health departments,"" said Alex R. Piquero, a University of Miami criminologist and former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""They are among the most respected of all health data collections.""

Although the CDC’s data is from 2022, the 2023FBI datashows the same general ranking pattern. The FBI collects data from law enforcement agencies rather than coroners’ offices.

Alabama ranked third among states with 10.3 homicides per 100,000 population; Arkansas ranked fifth with 9.4 per 100,000; and Oklahoma ranked 16th with 6.1 per 100,000. California ranked 25th with 5 per 100,000.

""There is a lot of research on the variation of homicides across states in the United States, and both the CDC and FBI show"" that Newsom is generally accurate, Piquero said.

One technical note: In his posts, Newsom flipped back and forth between referring to the ""homicide"" rate and the ""murder"" rate. For the CDC data, he should have exclusively used the term ""homicide,"" because the CDC doesn’t use the term ""murder.""

The data on violent crime is less favorable to California.

The data the FBI collected for 2023 shows that Arkansas’ violent crime rate ranked fourth among the states, about 620 per 100,000 population. California ranked sixth with 508 per 100,000. That was higher than either Oklahoma (15th, with 414 per 100,000) and Alabama (19th with 404 per 100,000).

Newsom said California has lower homicide rates than Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma.

Data for 2022 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which criminologists consider a reliable source, show that California has a lower homicide rate than Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma, and roughly in the proportions that Newsom said.

Data from 2023 collected by the FBI generally mirrors the CDC data.

Looking at violent crime more broadly — a category that includes rape, aggravated assault and robbery in addition to homicide — California fares less well, notching rates higher than either Oklahoma and Alabama.

"George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC’s ""This Week,"" cut off an interview with U.S. Vice President JD Vance after Vance deflected a question about border czar Tom Homan.",True,"It was unclear at the time of this writing why Stephanopoulos chose to end Vance's interview when he did. The host ended his next interview, with Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, in a similar way.
On Oct. 12, 2025, U.S Vice President JD Vance's appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" ended abruptly during a discussion about White House border czar Tom Homan,who had been accused of accepting a $50,000 bribe to help undercover agents ""win government contracts in a second Trump administration,""according to areportMSNBC published in September.
During that discussion, Vance redirected host George Stephanopoulos' questions about what he knew about Homan and the reported bribe to talk about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which Vance blamed on Democrats.
According to the episodetranscript, Stephanopoulos ended the interview after Vance accused the host of ""going down some weird left-wing rabbit hole."" Stephanopoulos thanked the vice president and cut to a commercial break as Vance continued speaking.
Following the show, social media users reposted footage of the end of the interview. While somepraised(archived) Stephanopoulos' apparent decision to cut to commercials, others criticized him.
The X account Right Angle News Network, which featured a red elephant, the politicalsymbolof the Republican Party, in its profile banner,wrote(archived), ""BREAKING - Viewers are demanding an apology from George Stephanopoulos and ABC for cutting off Vice President JD Vance and going to commercial after Vance exposed him for lying about Tom Homan, saying, 'Here's, George, why fewer and fewer people watch your program.'""

Given the above, we rate the claim that Stephanopoulos cut Vance off after the vice president deflected a question about border czar Tom Homan true.
According to the show'stranscript, which corresponded to the video of the show, the interaction between Vance and Stephanopoulos went as follows:
VANCE: Let's talk about the real issues, George. I think the American people would benefit much more from that than from you going down some weird left-wing rabbit hole where the facts clearly show that Tom Homan didn't engage in any criminal wrongdoing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: It's not a weird left-wing rabbit hole. I didn't insinuate anything. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000 as was heard on an audiotape recorded by the FBI in September 2024, and you did not answer the question.
Thank you for your time this morning.
VANCE: No, George, I said that I don't --

STEPHANOPOULOS: -- is up next. We'll be right back.
Snopes reached out to ABC to ask why Stephanopoulos decided to end Vance's interview when he did. We also asked the vice president's office whether it had received an explanation for the abrupt end to the interview. We await replies to our queries.
Vance was not the only guest on the Oct. 12 ""This Week"" episode whose interview directly preceded a commercial break.

"During Gov. Hochul’s tenure, there has been “more crime on our streets.”",True,"A leading Republican called Gov. Kathy Hochul's track record ""abysmal"" on the heels of her recent gubernatorial visit to Western New York.

""The only thing New Yorkers have to show from her tenure are rising prices, increased wasteful spending, skyrocketing Medicaid costs due to fraud and abuse, and more crime on our streets,"" said Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, R-North Tonawanda.

Crime increases during the pandemic were well documented, but we wondered if Ortt’s claim of ""more crime on our streets"" since Hochul became governor on Aug. 24, 2021, is accurate.

New York state keeps track of seven ""index crimes"" for a reporting system developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Four of them are violent crimes: murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The other three are property crimes: burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.

Statewide datashow the number of crimes and the crime rate are up from 2021. From the first full year that Hochul held office, 2022, the count is higher but the rate is not.

Hochul took office in August 2021, and during that whole year, there were 345,980 index crimes in New York state, according to the state’s Division of Criminal Justice Services. In 2022, the first full year that Hochul was in office, the count increased to 423,815. The number of crimes rose to 440,771 in 2023 but fell to 424,312 in 2024. So the 2024 tally remained slightly above the 2022 count and well above the 2021 number.

The 2024 crime rate – the number of crimes measured against the population –  increased compared to the 2021 rate but fell compared to the 2022 rate. There were 2,136 reported crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2024, compared to 1,744 in 2021. But compared to 2022, the 2024 crime rate fell by less than 1%.

We asked Ortt’s office for evidence of his claim, and to clarify what geography he based his claim on.

He had statewide crime in mind, pointing to a2022 reportfrom the Office of the State Comptroller, which showed an increase in index crimes that year.

""Senator Ortt’s statement reflects a documented, sustained increase in crime during Gov. Hochul’s administration,"" said Director of Communications Matthew Mosher.

The crime statistics during Hochul’s tenure have ups and downs, not a sustained increase.

Ortt’s office also said he was referring to an increase in local crime. His office provided two news stories aboutrising car thefts in Western New York. In Amherst, car thefts have nearlydoubled in the last five years. Statewide statistics show the rate of motor vehicle thefts has increased by 45% since 2021, though it has trended down by 19% from 2023 to 2024.

The number of reported index crimes in Western New York was 2,017 for every 100,000 residents in 2021; 2,211 in 2022; and 2,257 in 2024. The data for  Western New York includes Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties.

We asked Hochul’s office about Ortt's claim, and her spokesperson referred to index crime data, as well as data that shows that shootings are down 19% this year through July 13, compared to last year. Her office also said shootings on record are at a historic low in New York City, and that outside of the city, New York is 10% below the previous lowest number of shootings. In 2024, shooting incidents with injury fell to the lowest point since the state started keeping count in 2006, the office said.

Statewide, violent crimes are up from 2021, but have been falling since 2022.

Jillian Snider, a former New York City police officer and policy director for criminal justice and civil liberties at R Street Institute, which supports limited government and free markets, said crime statistics and people’s feelings of relative safety can vary widely across the state. In addition, about half of crimes go unreported.

""This New York State index crime is only reflective of crimes where police are taking an active report,"" Snider said.

State data show more crime in 2024 than in 2021, though that isn’t true in every county, Snider said.

Ames Grawert, a lawyer who has written about crime trends and bail reform at the Brennan Center, said that like many states, New York saw some types of crime rise during the first years of the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Some of those trends have begun to decline. Murder, for example, is down sharply statewide since peaking in 2021,"" Grawert said. The number of murders statewide has fallen sharply since 2021, and the rate has fallen by 29%.

In Niagara County, Ortt’s home county, the number of crimes and the crime rate is lower now than in 2021. There were 3,852 crimes in 2021 and 3,259 in 2024, a decrease of 15%. The rate is also down by 15.6%. The crime rates of counties are calculated by dividing the number of index crimes by a county's population and multiplying by 100,000.

Ortt claimed Hochul has presided over an increase in crime over her tenure.

The rate of index crimes across the state is higher than when Hochul took office in 2021, but slightly lower than her first full year in office. Crime rates vary by place, and looking at specific crimes or specific jurisdictions yields different trends. The Hochul administration focused on reductions in shootings. The crime rate in Ortt’s own county has fallen since 2021.

As for all index crimes statewide, Ortt’s statement is accurate but needs additional information.

We rate this Mostly True.

"U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, demanded a federal investigation into Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk for allegedly receiving a $350,000 transfer prior to the death of her husband, Charlie Kirk.",False,"A rumor that circulated online in October 2025 claimed U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, demanded a federal investigation into Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk for allegedly receiving a $350,000 transfer prior to the Sept. 10deathof her husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk. According to the story, Erika Kirk received the payment from a Delaware shell company that vanished days later.
One Snopes reader emailed us a story request in the form of a statement reading, ""Erica Kirk 'receiving' 350k wire transfer from a Delaware company that was dissolved 4 days later, and being called out by Jasmine Crockett.""
On Oct. 26, a user managing the Power & Progress Facebook pageposted(archived) the claim and received tens of thousands of engagements.Usersalsosharedthe claim onFacebook(archived),Instagram(archived) andX(archived).

The Power & Progress page's post featured a link to an advertisement-filled WordPress blogarticle. The post read as follows:
After leaked documents revealed a $350,000 transfer to Erica Kirk just weeks before her husband's mysterious death, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett has broken her silence — and Washington is shaking.

""When ordinary people lose loved ones, they get grief. Not secret payments. That's not sympathy — that's guilt.""
Crockett is demanding a federal investigation, calling out a Delaware shell company that vanished days after wiring the money. She vows to uncover the truth — no matter who's behind it.
""Follow the money. Every dollar tells a story.""
As the nation watches, one question echoes through Capitol Hill: Who really sent the money?
In short, the rumor Crockett called for a federal investigation into Erika Kirk was false. Facebook users residing outside the U.S. entirely fabricated the rumor, including the claim about the $350,000 transfer. The Power & Progress Facebook page's ""page transparency"" tabrevealedtheir managers resided in Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia.
The advertisements appearing with the WordPress blogarticle— containing text resembling stories generated with artificial-intelligence (AI) tools — indicated a clear profit motive. The article ended with several sentences of forward-thinking, dramatized statements in the same way AI tools conclude similar fabricated stories. For example, the final sentence read, ""And as the Capitol lights burn late into the night, one thing is certain — this scandal is only just beginning.""
Other Facebook users shared variants of the story about Erika Kirk and the $350,000 transfer, but with comedianDave Chappelle(archived), rapperEminem(archived) and golferRory McIlroy(archived) named instead of Crockett as the person allegedly asking for a federal investigation.
Snopes contacted Crockett's office and Turning Point USA to ask if they wished to comment about this false rumor. We also inquired with the Power & Progress page about the nature of their content and will update this story if we receive further information.
A similar untrue storyusersalsoshared(archived) in October 2025 featured a meme reading, ""Breaking News: Jasmine Crockett alleges Charlie Kirk's death was a cover-up for a massive financial fraud, accusing Erika Kirk and insiders of hiding the truth.""

“President Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1 billion in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.”,True,"Liz Oyer, a longtime Justice Department attorney handling pardons, wasfiredby the Trump administration in March. Since then, Oyer has publicly criticized the administration, including its approach to pardons.

In anApril 30 TikTok, Oyer took issue with many of Trump’s pardons, not only because they short-circuited the justice system but also because of their financial impact.

""President Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1 billion in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law,"" said Oyer, who said she was fired because she opposed a pardon to restore gun rights to actor Mel Gibson, a Trump supporter who was convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges in 2011.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., shared her post May 31 onInstagram, saying Trump is ""selling pardons to criminals who dump money on him and ingratiate themselves to his ego. They not only get out of jail, but they get out of the money they owe to make restitution for their crimes. This is wrong.""

Oyer’sSubstackincludes a running list of Trump’s pardons, along with a dollar figure for each that she says the pardon erased. The dollar figures on her list include fines — a financial penalty for being convicted of a crime — and restitution, which is designed to compensate victims for their losses.

As of June 5, Oyer’s pardon tracker listed 24 people with federal convictions who Trump pardoned, along with the dollar amounts to be forgiven.

On the surface, the math holds: Collectively, the 24 pardoned people and companies Oyer listed were on the hook for $1.34 billion.

""A full pardon would wipe out any payments that were required as part of the criminal sentence,"" as long as they have not already been paid, said Brian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor.

But legal experts offered some caveats about this calculation. Some of the dollar amounts on Oyer’s list were not finalized, which adds some speculation to her total.

Oyer did not respond to inquiries for this article.

After 4.5 months in office, Trump has surpassed all but three post-World War II presidents for the number of clemency actions, which include pardons and commutations. His total is dominated by the roughly 1,500pardonshe granted to people who faced legal consequences from their participation in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The vast majority of clemency actions by Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, were commutations, meaning they did not affect fines or restitution. (Bidencommutedsentences for 37 people on death row and about 2,500 others convicted of nonviolent drug crimes.) Biden pardoned 80 people over four years; Trump has pardoned 58 people in 4.5 months, not including theJan. 6, 2021-relatedpardons.

The four pardon recipients on Oyer’s list with the highest debt would collectively exceed $1 billion by themselves. They are:

Trevor Milton, an electric-truck company owner who had beenconvictedof securities fraud and wire fraud in 2023 and sentenced to 48 months in prison. He was ordered to pay $676 million in restitution.

Ross William Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, an online marketplace that sold illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Ulbricht had been convicted of aiding and abetting the distribution of drugs over the internet; continuing criminal enterprise; computer hacking conspiracy; and money laundering conspiracy. He had been sentenced to life in prison. (Ulbricht’s pardon fulfilled a Trump campaignpromise.) Ulbricht was ordered to pay almost $184 million.

HDR Global Trading Limited, operator of a cryptocurrency exchange that had beenorderedto pay a $100 million fine for violating the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money-laundering provisions.

Lawrence Duran, owner of American Therapeutic Corp., a Miami-area mental health company, convicted of multiple counts related to health care fraud; Duran wassentencedto 50 years in prison and $87.5 million in restitution.

However, it’s unclear whether these four would add up to $1 billion-plus in forgone payments to the federal government, because not every amount listed had been formally approved by a judge.

""Almost always, a pardon has come after sentencing, so we know the amount of the fine or restitution with certainty,"" said Mark Osler, a University of St. Thomas law professor. But at least in Milton’s case, the pardon came before the restitution portion of his sentencing was completed.

Milton’s is the most important pardon recipient for judging the accuracy of Oyer’s statement, because it’s the largest, accounting for about two-thirds of the $1 billion figure.

Milton was sentenced in December 2023, but legal skirmishing over his restitution package was delayed. In March 2025, federal prosecutorsrequestedthat the judge approve $676 million in restitution — $660.8 million to shareholders in his company and $15 million to one victim. That request was pending at the time of Milton’s pardon.

It’s impossible to know whether the judge would have ultimately accepted that amount.

Defendants can contest the prosecution’s restitution request, and often do, said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri emeritus law professor.

However, ""a judge will usually accept"" what the government suggests, Osler said.

For the second-, third- and fourth-ranking dollar amounts on Oyer’s list, each was finalized in court. For these, though, it’s unclear whether the pardon recipients had already begun to pay any of their restitution. If they had, that could reduce the dollar amounts on Oyer’s list. (Our reporting did not turn up a central, publicly accessible repository showing who had paid what by the time of their pardon.)

Restitution owed by Jan. 6, 2021, pardon recipients, which is not included in Oyer’s figure, could also push the total higher. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a March 2025letterthat people receiving pardons related to Jan. 6, 2021, owed nearly $3 million in restitution before being pardoned.

Other high-profile names on Oyer’s list with smaller dollar amounts include:Devon Archer, Hunter Biden’s former business partner, who was interviewed by congressional Republicans during an investigation of Joe Biden, Hunter’s father;Carlos Watson, the founder ofOzy Media Inc., who was convicted on several fraud counts; reality TV starsTodd ChrisleyandJulie Chrisley, who were also convicted on fraud counts; and former politiciansMichael Grimm,John Rowland,Michelle FioreandAlexander Sittenfeld.

Oyertold The Washington Postthat when deciding clemency, past presidents have hewed closer to the recommendations of her former Justice Department office, which has guidelines stating that potential pardon recipients should have already completed their sentence, including paying any restitution.

""It’s unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds,"" Oyer told the Post. ""They do not meet Justice Department standards for recommending a pardon.""

Legal experts told PolitiFact that courts haven’t ruled on what  happens to fines or restitution payments after a pardon if they had not already been paid. A 1995 Justice Departmentmemosaid that although payments already made and received would not be subject to being clawed back, the obligations not yet paid at the time of the pardon would be forgiven.

""This question, to our knowledge, has not been decided by any court, but we conclude, based upon existing precedent, that a pardon does reach such restitution where the victim has not yet received the restitution award, provided the pardon does not contain an express limitation to the contrary,"" the memo said.

Margaret Love, who held Oyer’s former post at the Justice Department from 1990 to 1997, said, ""If money is paid to the government, you can’t get the money back except through a congressional appropriation.""

For restitution intended to compensate a person — such as the victim of a fraudulent scheme — it appears that the victims are out of luck once a pardon is issued if they have not already received that money, legal experts said. It’s unclear whether the victims would be obligated to repay the restitution they’d already received back to the pardoned convict who defrauded them.

""I don’t know if it has ever come up,"" Osler said.

Oyer said, ""President Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1 billion in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.""

In 24 Trump pardons Oyer cited, the four biggest dollar amounts top $1 billion. However, the single biggest — about $676 million — relates to an amount sought by prosecutors that had not been formally approved by a judge before the pardon was issued, making the dollar figure speculative. It accounts for about two-thirds of the $1 billion figure.

The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True."
An image authentically shows a decades-old photo of then-businessman and future U.S. President Donald Trump in a robe lying across a bed.,True,"A rumor that circulated online in November 2025 claimed an image showed a decades-old photo of then-businessman and future U.S. President Donald Trump in a robe lying sideways on a bed.
Snopes readers asked about this matter, with one user emailing, ""Is the picture of Trump laying on a bed in a white robe real?""
Userssharedthe alleged photo onFacebook(archived),Instagram(archived),Threads(archived) andX(archived).Someusersalsopostedan image meme with the picture, claiming, ""Someone pointed out that those are Strawberry Shortcake bedsheets and now I cannot unsee that."" A Snopes reader emailed with the Strawberry Shortcake question, as well.
In short, the photo was authentic and was published years before the public availability of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools. A close-up examination of the pillowcases and bedding found no online matches for vintage products oneBayor other reselling websites tied to the Strawberry Shortcake brand, whichoriginatedon greeting cards in 1973 anddebutedits animated children's TV series in 1980.
The British tabloidThe Daily Mailfirst published the picture on Nov. 8, 2016 — Election Day — in an album of more than two dozen vintage photos of Trump's family, including his first wife, Ivana. They described the picture as follows: ""One photo in the collection has a sexy looking young Trump shirtless and in a white terry cloth robe seated, as well as sprawled across a bed, in a very Burt Reynolds, 'Cosmopolitan' magazine-type pose, showing exposed legs."" The photo's location and year were not included in the description.
Stand-up comedian Patton Oswalttweeted(archived) a joke in one of the more popular postings of the photo on the same day as its publishing.
The Daily Mail article credited an anonymous collector with providing the picture, who said that in an unspecified year prior to 2016 she happened upon the suitcase of roughly 1,000 photos and other personal items at a thrift shop in Palm Beach, Florida. The tabloid added of the collector, referencing Trump's 1990divorce, ""She suspects that Ivana or an assistant brought the items into the shop when she downsized to a condo.""
Other photos in the collection allegedly showed Trump changing the diaper of one of his children, Trump spending time with his children at their very young ages, Trump with his mother, Mary, around Christmastime and other moments.
Regarding The Daily Mail, in 2017, Wikipedia editorsbannedthe tabloid from being used as a source, calling their reporting ""generally unreliable."" In this case, the collection of published pictures — including an image of the suitcase itself containing the roughly 1,000 pictures — substantiated the in-question photo as authentic.
The vintage photo of Trump wearing a bathrobe made the rounds online amid votes in the U.S. Senate and House for (and Trump himself signing off on) the release of case files related to the late, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The Associated PressreportedTrump could have chosen to release many of the files on his own months before.
In a June 2024interviewwith Fox News — months prior to his November reelection victory — Trumpsaid(35:19) he would declassify files related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. Then, when asked if he would declassify the Epstein files, Trump answered, in part, ""Yeah, yeah, I would. I guess I would. I think that, less so, because, you know, you don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because it's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.""
Fox News initiallyedited Trump's answerabout the Epstein files for broadcast on the cable news network on June 2, only airing his first mention of ""yeah,"" then skipping to a different question. The network thenbroadcastthe longer answer on the following day.
Months later, in a September 2024 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Trumpsaid(44:15) of Epstein, in part, ""I never went to his island, fortunately."" He also said he'd ""be inclined"" to release the Epstein files, adding, ""I'd have no problem with it.""
In past years, users sharedauthenticphotosof Trump posing with Epstein and Epstein's confidant,convictedsex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as avideoshowing Trump and Epstein chatting at a 1992 party while watching a group of women dance.
In 2002, TrumptoldNew York Magazine he consideredEpstein a ""terrific guy,"" adding: ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""
As of this writing, the Epstein files had not yet been released, and no available credible evidence tied Trump to Epstein's sex crimes.
Days before Trump signed the bill to release the Epstein files, on Nov. 12, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reformmade publicaround 23,000 documentsrelated to Epstein after receiving them from his estate.
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee alsoreleasedthree emails, including one sayingTrump ""knew about the girls."" One of the other emails from Epstein to MaxwellsaidTrump ""spent hours"" at Epstein's house with a sex-trafficking victim.
Regarding the Democratic-released emails, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitttold Snopes by email, in part, ""The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.""
One of the emailsfeaturedMark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein's brother, sending a message suggesting Jeffrey Epstein ask former White House adviser Steve Bannon ""if Putin has the photos of Trump blowing Bubba,"" referencing oral sex.
Some userssuggested""Bubba"" was referring to former President Bill Clinton. On Nov. 16,The Advocatereported Mark Epstein responded to the rumor: ""For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to 'Bubba' in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.""

The spread of Trump's alleged quote led to an influx ofsearchesfrom Snopes readers looking to find out whether the president actually made the claim that the ballroom's construction would not result in any interference with the existing White House.
The quote was correctly attributed to Trump. Snopes reached out to the White House Press Office for comment about the apparent contradiction between Trump's words and the numerous credible reports about and images of the demolition and will update this story if we receive a response.
The president made the statement while answering a question from a reporter during a news conference on July 31, 2025.

At the 21:47 mark of the YouTube video, a reporter asked, ""Can you talk about your plans for the new ballroom that was announced today? And the $200 million that's going to be paid for by yourself as well as private donations?""
Trump responded (emphasis ours):
It's a private thing. You know, I'll do it and we'll probably have some donors or whatever, but it's about $200 million. So, we've been planning it for a long time. They've wanted a ballroom at the White House for more than 150 years, but there's never been a president that was good at ballrooms. I'm really good. In fact, I looked at one that we just built in Turnberry in Scotland, and it's incredible. We're good at building. I'm good at building things, and we'll get it built quickly and on time and it'll be beautiful. Top of the line. We've retained the best architects and engineers, everything else.
It'll be built over on the east side, and it will be beautiful. It'll be views of the Washington Monument.It won't interfere with the current building. It'll be near it but not touching it.And pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of. It's my favorite. It's my favorite place. I love it. But they've wanted it. And you know, when they have big events, you entertain the president of China or the president of any place and you have big crowds, they've always had to get a tent. And you've probably been to some of them, Bobby. When it rains, it's a disaster. And the tent's a hundred yards. That's more than a football field away from the main entrance. And people are schlopping down to the tent. It's not a pretty sight. The women with their lovely evening gowns, all of their hair all done and they're a mess by the time they get and they've always wanted to have it.
And I said, you know, in the first term, I said, you know, if I get another shot at this, I'm going to do a ballroom. I was pretty busy in the first because I was running the country and I was also fighting for survival with all of the lunatics I had to beat. But it worked out. Obviously, it worked out very well because here we are. But I always said I was going to do something about the ballroom because they should have one. So, we'll be leaving it. It'll be a great legacy project and I think it'll be special. You saw some renderings of the initial. I think it'll be really beautiful.
This isn't the firstrumorabout the planned ballroom we've investigated. For example, when we asked aboutballroom construction moving forward during the government shutdownin early October 2025, the White House said in an email, ""Ballroom construction is continuing as it is financed by private donations, not the federal appropriations that Democrats are holding up to push free health care for illegal immigrants."""
"Says White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Jesus didn’t have electricity and he did just fine.”",False,"At a Jan. 31 White House press briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt fielded multiple questions about the tariffs President Donald Trump has threatened against Mexico and Canada.

But she didn’t respond to one of those questions by saying, ""Remember, Jesus didn’t have electricity either and he did just fine.""

Some social mediapostshave claimed otherwise.

They were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

One Feb. 1 Threads post that attributed the quote to Leavitt also linked to a Jan. 31Irish Star article on the website NewsBreakthat said Leavitt was ""hit with claims she told press ‘Jesus didn’t have electricity either.’""

But that article hadinitially reportedthat Leavitt ""shocks as she tells press ‘Jesus didn’t have electricity either.’""

""When asked about the tariff war between Canada and the United States after the prime minister of Canada said he would consider cutting off electricity to America if Donald Trump continues to impose tariffs, she referenced Jesus Christ,"" the Irish Star article said.

""‘They want you to panic, but President Trump wants you to remember Jesus didn’t have electricity either and he did just fine,’ Leavitt said.""

That articlehas since been updatedwith a new headline: ""Karoline Leavitt hit with false claims she told press ‘Jesus didn’t have electricity either.’""

But as of Feb. 4, it still included the same image of Leavitt at the Jan. 31 White House briefing with this caption: ""Karoline Leavitt confused members of the press when answering a question for the Trump administration.""

Leavittdidn’t mentionJesus or electricity during the press briefing, video and a transcript of the briefing shows.

One reporter asked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that Trudeau ""said today that if the U.S. imposes tariffs, he will respond and he will not relent until the tariffs are removed. Are we seeing the start of a trade war with Canada?""

Leavitt responded: ""I don’t think so. I think the president is going to implement those tariffs tomorrow and he will respond to Mr. Trudeau’s comments in due time, I am sure.""

Leavitt also answered multiple questions about tariffs at her firstpress briefing, Jan. 28, but didn’t mention Jesus or electricity then, either.

TrumpsaidFeb. 1 that he was imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. On Feb. 3,he agreedto pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days.

Fact-checking publication Snopesreportedthat claims about Leavitt’s comments appear to have originated in aReddit postthat has since been deleted. This post featured animageof Leavitt at the Jan. 28 press briefing with this quote: ""They want you to panic, but Trump wants you to remember — Jesus didn’t have electricity either, and he did just fine.""

The person who posted the image with the quote said in response to a question about its authenticity that it wasn’t real, Snopes reported.

""Actually I’m making light of the fact that nobody even asked the question to begin with,"" the poster said. ""Canadian premiers, like Doug Ford, are publicly threatening to shut down electricity to the Northeastern U.S. in response to Trump’s tariff trade war, and not a single reporter has asked if Trump is calling their bluff.""

In December, Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada,threatenedto cut off energy supplies to the United States in response to Trump’s tariffs.

“The media is showing how Obama’s birth certificate was changed! He was never born in the U.S. so he was never a real president!”,False,"Almost a decade after Joe Arpaio, then sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, hosted a news conference to further and falsely cast doubt on former President Barack Obama’s citizenship, some social media posts are reframing the event as new news.

""Wow! About time!"" a Feb. 19 Facebookpostsaid. ""The media is showing how Obama’s birth certificate was changed! He was never born in the U.S. so was never a real president! Everything he signed will be reversed!""

The post included news footage of the press conference.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

First: Obama is a U.S. citizen who was born in the United States. But that hasn’t stopped people from baselessly claiming he was born in Kenya. Over more than a decade, PolitiFact hasfact-checked 30-some statementsabout Obama’s birthplace.

Arpaio is among those who have made such false claims. In 2016, he summoned journalists to a press conference to talk about Obama’s ""fake, fake birth certificate."" Mike Zullo, a member of Arpaio’s ""Cold Case Posse,"" ""explained how a careful analysis of the document’s typed letters and words, as well as the angles of the date stamps, proved forgery,"" the Arizona Republicreportedat the time.

""According to the theory,"" the Republic said, ""the birth certificate presented to the public was created after copying and pasting information from the legitimate birth certificate of a woman born in Hawaii.""

But that’s wrong.

After the Obama campaign released a copy of his ""Certification of Birth"" from Hawaii, posting the documentonlinein June 2008, FactCheck.org reporters went to the campaign’s headquarters to hold the document and examine it closely. They concluded that it was legitimate.

A few months later, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, then director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement saying that he and the registrar of vital statistics ""who has the statutory authority to oversee and maintain these types of vital records"" had personally seen and verified that the health department had Obama’s original birth certificate on record.

Janice Okubo, a health department spokesperson, told PolitiFact that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are no doubt differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and the documents issued today.

And if there was a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it went back decades — to the month he was born in 1961.

Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in theHonolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961, and the other was in theHonolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4."" They were both submitted to the newspaper by the health department — not Obama’s family.

""Take a second and think about that,"" PolitiFact reported in 2009. ""In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.""

“I have ended seven unendable wars.”,False,"In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump said ""everyone"" is saying he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for ending seven wars.""I have ended seven unendable wars,"" Trump said Sept. 23 in New York. ""They said they were unendable. You're never going to get them solved. Some were going for 31 years. … I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed.""

Trump has repeated a version of this claim for months. In his U.N. speech, Trump listed the conflicts: Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.

PolitiFact previously rated a similar statement Trump made about ending ""six"" warsMostly False. That was before a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.The talking point he used at the U.N. remains misleading.Trump played a role in a number of peace deals that have recently eased conflicts between some of these countries, sometimes using the threat of tariffs or military action. But many of the agreements are temporary, fragile, or have yet to be implemented. In some cases, leaders dispute that Trump played a deescalatory role. In others, there’s little evidence that a potential war was brewing. Fighting continues between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Cambodia and Thailand.

""Brokering an agreement is a first and important step in ending wars, but it is also just the start of a process that needs follow-through,"" said Ken Schultz, a Stanford University political scientist who studies international conflict and conflict resolution. ""The Armenia-Azerbaijan accord still needs to be implemented. India and Pakistan have had many ceasefires in their decades-long conflict. It will take time, and a commitment to follow through by the United States, before we know if history will see these deals as having ended wars.""

The White House did not respond to a request for evidence.

After U.S.-backed talks, Cambodia and Thailand paused military attacks, but there have been violent clashes since the July 28 agreement of a ceasefire.

On July 28, Cambodia and Thailandagreedto a ceasefire after a territorial dispute escalated into an armed conflict July 24, killing dozens and displacing more than 300,000 people. It marked the deadliest conflict between the two nations in more than a decade.On July 26, Trumpsaidhe was speaking with both countries' leaders and that the U.S. would not negotiate trade deals with either country unless the fighting stopped. U.S.-backed talks began July 28, the same day the ceasefire was announced.

Trump said he instructed his team to restart trade negotiations, and both countries agreed not to deploy more troops to the contested border.Experts questionedhow long the deal will last, because it didn’t address the underlying dispute about which country can lay claim to 1,000-year-old Hindu temples along the 500-mile border.

They may already have their answer, as both sides havetraded accusations of ceasefire violationsamid flaring tensions.

On Sept. 17,a crowd of 200 Cambodians crossed into Thai territory to protest and dismantle new security barriers along the disputed border. Thai policeused tear gas and rubber bulletsto disperse the crowd, injuring dozens of Cambodians. Thailand’s military said a number of its members were injured.

Thai military leaderslater votedto indefinitely close the border with Cambodia and said they would impose Thai laws on Cambodian citizens living in villages along the disputed area, prompting more protests.

Accounts vary about whether these two countries were headed toward war. Trump says they were, and that he helped head it off. Kosovobacked upTrump’s account; Serbiadeniedit had any war plans.

OnJune 27, Trump said Serbia and Kosovo were on the verge of war. ""Serbia was … getting ready to go to war with a group. I won't even mention, because it didn’t happen, we were able to stop it,"" Trump said at anOval Office press conference. ""But I have a friend in Serbia, and they said, 'we're going to go to war again.' And I won’t mention that it's Kosovo, but it's Kosovo. But they were going to have a big-time war, and we stopped it. We stopped it because of trade. They want to trade with the United States and I said we don't trade with people that go to war.""

Trump hascontinued to sayhe stopped a new conflict without providing more details.

Relations in the region remain unsettled. On Sept. 12, Trump’s administration suspended a strategic dialogue with Kosovo, citing unspecified actions and statements by officials from a caretaker government that’s been in office for seven months amid a political crisis,according to the Atlantic Council.

Violence in the region has continued after Trump brokered a deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.

On June 27, the foreign ministers of Rwanda and Congosigneda U.S.-brokered peace agreement in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to end their deadly conflict that has lasted almost three decades. Trumpcalledthe moment ""a glorious triumph for the cause of peace."" The agreement also allows for U.S. investment in eastern Congo’s critical mineral reserves, including gold, copper and lithium.The deal is part of an effort to stop violence in the eastern part of Congo, where the militia group M23 occupies large swaths of territory. Countries,including the U.S., have accused Rwanda of backing the militia, which Rwanda has denied.Foreign policy expertscautionedthe early summer agreement was significant but part of a long string of broken agreements between the two countries, including a long-term ceasefire agreement reached in mid 2024 that collapsed months later.

Despite the Trump-era agreement, violence in the region has continued.CNN reported Sept. 22that militia groups in the region continue to be trained and are still fighting. In one province, an aid worker told CNN that fighting is ""going on every day"" and people are still being displaced.ASept. 5 U.N. Human Right Office reportdetailed violations and human rights abuses committed by the groups in 2025. The report said that a deadly massacre, allegedly by M23 and Rwandan soldiers, took place weeks after the late June agreement signing.""In July, M23 members, together with alleged soldiers of the RDF (Rwandan Defense Force) and civilians armed with machetes, massacred hundreds of people — mainly Hutus — in four villages in Rutshuru. This is one of the deadliest incidents recorded since the M23’s resurgence in 2022,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türktold the Human Rights Council on Sept. 9. Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group,reportedon the violence in late August, counting 140 civilian deaths.Other reportshave said the number of people killed in the conflict since July may exceed 300.

""During the period of July 9 to 21, at least 319 civilians — including forty-eight women and nineteen children — were killed by the rebels, who are still thought to be backed by members of the Rwanda Defense Force,"" Charles A. Ray, chair of the Africa program at the foreign policy research institute, and former U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia and Zimbabwe,wrote Aug. 28.

The two countries ended a period of tit-for-tat military strikes in May, though Trump’s role is in dispute.

India and Pakistan’s leadersagreed to a ceasefireMay 10 after days of military strikes between the two nuclear-armed countries. The conflict centered around the territorial dispute over Kashmir, a region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. India controls the central and southern portions and Pakistan controls the northern and western parts. The countries have fought over the territory since1947.

Trumpsaidthe deal was reached after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by the U.S. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifthanked Trumpfor his ""leadership and proactive role.""Indian leaders disputed that Trump’s intervention factored into the ceasefire.

Hours after Trump took credit for the agreement, India Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram MisriannouncedMay 10 that Pakistan’s director general of military operations had initiated a call with his Indian counterpart and both sides agreed to ""stop all firing and military action on land and in the air and sea."" He didn’t mention the U.S.On July 28, India Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said the country ""halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved. To suggest that the operation was called off under pressure is baseless and entirely incorrect.""

On July 30, India External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also rejected third-party mediation in the ceasefire, and saidno foreign leaderasked India to halt its military operations.

Long-running hostilities between the two countries erupted into military action earlier this year.

Israel launched attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities June 13 that killed prominent politicians, military leaders and nuclear scientists. Iran responded with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites.

Israel’s goal of eliminating Iran’s nuclear capabilities led to theU.S.bombing Iran’s heavily reinforced facilities atFordo, where its uranium enrichment facility is buried deep underground. Just over a week after Israel first attacked, Trump authorized the U.S. military to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo.Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire June 24 mediated by the U.S. and Qatar. Trumpannounced the dealon Truth Social on June 23.Experts said it’s difficult to know how much influence Trump had in the talks but said his decision to bomb Iran likely ended the conflict more quickly.A longer-term accord does not seem likely soon.

Iranapproved a lawin early July to end cooperation with the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneirejectednew direct nuclear talks with the U.S. in September.

Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corpsreleaseda Sept. 21 statement saying that any hostile action, particularly by the U.S. or Israel, against Iran’s national interests or territory will produce a ""decisive, crushing, and timely response.""

The disagreement doesn’t seem to be over.Ethiopiacompletedits $4 billion hydroelectric dam in July, capping a 14-year construction project.

Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr AbdelattyannouncedJune 29 that talks with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam have officially stalled,according to Egyptian Streets.Trump weighed in a few weeks later. ""I think if I’m Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile and we’re working on that one, probably, but it’s going to get solved,"" he said at aJuly 14 White House meeting. ""It’s a very important source of income and life, it’s the life of Egypt, and to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we are going to have that solved very quickly.""Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, a Trump ally, praised Trump’s commentJuly 16, saying it ""demonstrates the seriousness of the United States — under President Trump’s leadership — in exerting efforts to resolve conflicts and end wars.""But Ethiopianofficials and expertssaid his remarks risked aggravating the fragile situation and undermining Ethiopia’s right to natural resources. A similar incidentoccurred in 2020when Trump said the dam could be ""blown up"" by Egypt when Ethiopia didn’t make a deal with the downstream nations. ""I had a deal done for them, and then unfortunately, Ethiopia broke the deal which it should not have done,"" Trump said, referring to his first-term effort to end the conflict.Raising the stakes, Egypt hasmoved to armSomalia — which has been unhappy with Ethiopian moves to use a port in the breakaway region of Somaliland — as well as deploying troops there.

With Trump’s involvement, this long-running conflict has produced a peace agreement, though it needs to be finalized, and it remains to be seen whether it brings stability.The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan joined Trump at the White House on Aug. 8 tosign a joint peace declarationafter nearly 40 years of conflict, including Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region in the area claimed by both countries. The deal is not a final peace agreement, but represents a move in that direction,foreign policy experts said.""What paved the way for a deal was the military victories by Azerbaijan, mass displacement of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia's abandonment by Russia,"" said Schultz, of Stanford University. ""These events created an opportunity for a deal, and Trump helped broker the actual agreement. This is no small matter, and he deserves credit for helping, but the hard choices were made by the leaders of the states themselves.""Trump also got something out of it. The country’s leaders approved a plan for a new road-and-rail connection linking Azerbaijan with Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani exclave bordered by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey,Foreign Affairs reported.Armenia has given development rights to the corridor across its territory to an American company while maintaining control of the passage, which is to be named the ""Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.""Both Armenia and Azerbaijan say the ball is in the other’s court,according to the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that researches global crises. Armenia says it’s ready to sign the deal and Azerbaijan says Armenia must remove its claims to Azerbaijani territory from its constitution, which could be rejected by Armenian voters.

Trump said he ""ended seven unendable wars"" around the world. This is exaggerated.Trump had a hand in ceasefires that have recently eased conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. But these were mostly incremental accords without a certainty of long-term peace, and some leaders have disputed the extent of Trump’s role.The U.S. was involved in forging a temporary peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, but violence in the region has continued, with hundreds of civilians estimated to have been killed since the deal’s signing. Trump also helped broker a deal between Cambodia and Thailand but both sides have accused the other of ceasefire violations that have led to violent skirmishes.A long-running standoff between Egypt and Ethiopia over an Ethiopian dam on the Nile remains unresolved. In the case of Kosovo and Serbia, there is little evidence a potential war was brewing."

“We had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion” under former President Joe Biden.,False,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed former President Joe Biden for the rising agricultural trade deficit, while defending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on nearly every country.

""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion,"" Rollins said in an April 6 CNNinterview. She was responding to host Jake Tapper’s question about uncertainty for U.S. farmers amid implementation of Trump’s tariffs.

Trump declared a 90-daypauseon most of his tariffs April 9 after backlash and stock market declines. Trumpdid notpause a 125% tariff on China.

The agriculture trade deficit, when the value of imports exceeds the value of exports, has increased for several years. But Rollins' statement misleads by cherry picking data and blaming Biden and his policies.

The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mainly spans Trump’s current administration.

And the agricultural export deficit was not zero when Trump left office; it was $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2020, Trump’s last full fiscal year during his first term.

USDA did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.

Agricultural economists said there are several reasons why the agricultural trade deficit has grown, and Trump’s tariffs during his first term is a major one.

In February, the Department of Agriculture published areportforecasting agricultural trade for fiscal year 2025, which started in October 2024. The report projected a $49 billion agricultural trade deficit, arecord high. The previous record was set in fiscal year 2024.

Fiscal year 2025 covers about four months of Biden’s administration and about eight months of Trump’s current administration. Also, USDA updates its projections periodically throughout the year, so it’s unclear what the final trade deficit will be for fiscal year 2025 and whether Trump’s current tariffs will affect it.

During Trump’s first term, his administration gave U.S. farmers$28 billion in subsidiesafter tariffs on Chinadecimated the U.S. agricultural export market. The New York Times reported March 31 that the current administration is considering whether to give emergency aid to farmers.

During her CNN interview, Rollins said USDA ""will make sure that we have the funds"" for farmer subsidies if needed.

Historically, the U.S. had an agricultural trade surplus. But in fiscal year 2019, during Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, according to the USDA report.

Since fiscal year 2019, the U.S. has fluctuated between an agricultural trade deficit and surplus. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, USDA recorded trade deficits of $1.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.

In the first two years of the Biden administration — fiscal years 2021 and 2022 — USDA recorded trade surpluses. In the last two years of the Biden administration, it moved into record-high trade deficits.

There are two ways to potentially reach Rollins’ number of a zero trade deficit, both misleading.

One way is to consider the fiscal year when Trump left office. Fiscal year 2021, which included the last few months of Trump’s first administration, had a trade surplus. But Biden was president during most of that year.

The other way is to look at the calendar year instead of the fiscal year. In the 2020 calendar year, Trump’s last full year in office during his first term, USDAreporteda $3.4 billion agricultural trade surplus. But Rollins’ $49 billion deficit figure aimed at Biden pointed to a fiscal year. Using a fiscal year to blame Biden for a trade deficit and a calendar year to praise Trump for a trade surplus is disingenuous.



Agricultural economists said the agricultural trade deficit has increased for several reasons, including Trump’s first term tariffs, the strength of the U.S. dollar and U.S. consumer demand for imported goods.

Tariffs on China during Trump’s first term

In 2018, Trump implemented tariffs against China. China retaliated by shifting its imports away from the U.S., producing goods domestically or trading with other countries. For example, instead ofimporting soybeansfrom the U.S., China began importing from Brazil.

That ""started the path to (agricultural) deficits,"" William Alan Reinsch, an international trade expert at Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.

The strength of the U.S. dollar

The U.S. dollar’s value has beenrisingsince the Great Recession waned in 2011. That means its exchange rate is higher against other currencies.

A strong dollar canbenefitAmericans traveling overseas, because their dollars buy more local currency. It also makes importsrelatively cheaper. But the strong dollar has also contributed to the agricultural trade deficit, Reinsch said, because U.S. exports cost more overseas.

""The strong US dollar and weakened foreign currencies are making it more difficult for countries to buy US exports,"" Betty Resnick, an agricultural economist,wrotein a February report.

U.S. consumer demand for imported goods

U.S. consumers have strong demand for coffee, year-round access to fruit and vegetables and alcohol. Those are products the U.S. imports in part because they aren’t domestically grown in large enough quantities to meet demand. Increased demand for those products in the U.S. means they have to be imported. And increased imports can affect the trade deficit.

According to the USDA projection, agricultural imports are expected to increase by $4 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared with 2024.

In response to Trump’s tariffs, China announced an 84%retaliatorytariff on U.S. goods starting April 10.

""The major effect will come if other countries retaliate against our tariffs,"" Reinsch said, before China announced retaliatory tariffs. ""Agriculture is usually a prime target when that happens, and, given the additional tariffs being placed on China, you can expect most trade with China to be effectively cut off because of their retaliation.""

Trade relation disruptions as a result of Trump’s tariffs are likely to negatively affect U.S. farmers, the International Food Policy Research Institute, a think tank working to reduce poverty and end hunger, said in areport. The group said other countries such as Brazil and Argentina will likely step in to fill the gaps to sell products the U.S. usually exports, such as soybeans, beef and corn.

""This shift is expected to reshape the global agricultural market,"" the report said.

Rollins said, ""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion.""

The agricultural trade deficit was not zero when Trump left office. In fiscal year 2021, Trump’s last full fiscal year in office during his first term, USDA recorded a $3.7 billion trade deficit. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, in part because of tariffs he imposed on China.

The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mostly spans Trump’s current administration.

Attributing changes in the agricultural trade deficit to the president alone is misleading. Some factors that affect the trade deficit are out of the president’s control, such as consumer demand.

Rollins’ statement includes an element of truth because in the last two years of the Biden administration, agriculture trade moved into record-high deficits. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

A video circulating over the 2025 Labor Day weekend authentically showed a bag being thrown out of a White House window.,True,"A White House spokesperson confirmed the veracity of the footage and said a contractor was doing work while U.S. President Donald Trump was away.
Over the 2025 Labor Day weekend, a video shared online purportedly showing a bag being thrown out of a window of the White House. The footage spread asrumorsswelled that U.S. President Donald Trump was ill or dead, with some social media users suggesting that White House staff were discarding things as a result of Trump no longer being able to preside over the country.
For example, one Instagram user whoshared(archived) the clip claimed that it was peculiar for a window of the building to be open as the panes should be sealed as a consequence of the9/11 attacks. The caption read:
Why is stuff getting tossed out the White House window?? After 9/11 they sealed every window with bulletproof glass — you can't just crack one open. The whole pane has to come out.
And contractors aren't even allowed in the residence if the President's inside… sooo if work's being done. Trump wasn't there last night.
This ain't adding up.
The video and claim also appeared on Instagram's partner appThreadsandonFacebook,YouTubeandX.
A spokesperson for the White House confirmed via email that the clip was authentic and explained what it showed: ""It was a contractor who was doing regular maintenance while the President was gone."" Snopes asked them to confirm the day when this occurred. We will update this report if they respond.
However, usingGoogle MapsandGoogle Earth, it was possible to narrow down the location from which the footage was recorded.
Given that it showed the eastern facade of the White House at a downward angle, it could not have been shot from the U.S. Treasury building, which sits right next to the presidential residence and is roughly the same height. Instead, it appeared to have been filmed from the roof of theHotel Washingtonbuilding to the east of the Treasury. The cutlery noises and electronic music playing in the background appeared to corroborate this as the roof of Hotel Washington is home toVUE Rooftop, a restaurant and bar. One publicly available 360-degreephotoon Google Maps, taken at VUE Rooftop, showed the eastern facade of the White House from a similar viewpoint to that in the Instagramvideo.
The sunlight on the White House indicated that it was roughly late morning — close to noon — when the footage was recorded. The restaurant's website said that it isopenfrom 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Sundays and 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. on Mondays. Given the timing of when the video began circulating online, it appeared that a patron recorded it from their table on Sunday, Aug. 31, when Trump was reportedly playing golf at his Virginia golf club,according to CNN.
The bag appeared to be dropped from a window on the same floor that the Yellow Oval Room is located. According tovariousfloorplansof the White House, it was thrown from inside or next to a sitting room adjacent to the Lincoln Bedroom, known as the Lincoln Sitting Room.
However, on Sept. 2, Trump suggested in a news conference that the video had been generated using artificial intelligence (AI). The C-SPAN clip below showed him answering a question about it.
""That's probably AI,"" Trump said. Yet when the footage was run through several AI-detectingtools, they concluded it was legitimate.
Although the tools are not infallible, Snopes hasrepeatedlyfact-checkedAI-generated contentand found no evidence that this clip was createdby AI."
“The NFL admits to canceling Elon's DOGE Super Bowl ads.”,False,"Dodgy social media posts claimed some Super Bowl advertisements were missing from the television roster. The claims said the NFL shunned ads by the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an advisory group tasked with slashing government spending.

""The NFL admits to canceling Elon's DOGE Super Bowl ads,"" aFeb. 15 Threads postsaid. ""Time to cancel the NFL.""

We saw a similar claim about Elon Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO who’s spearheading DOGE, in anInstagram video.

The Threads post and Instagram video were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.)

These posts are not factual. The claim originated from aFeb. 12 Facebook postby America’s Last Line of Defense, which posts satirical content about political news and pop culture. The account’s description says, ""Nothing on this page is real."" But other users, such as the Threads post, often repackage the stories without that caveat.

PolitiFact haspreviously debunkedclaims that Musk spent $40 million on five DOGE Super Bowl commercials. There were no DOGE ads that night.

We found no reports that DOGE planned to advertise during the Feb. 9 Super Bowl telecast — much less that the NFL admitted to canceling the group’s ads. A search of Musk’s X account turned up no posts about the league axing DOGE ads.

Fact-checkers at LeadStoriesratedsimilar claims false. The NFL did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.

Although Musk has become the unofficial head of DOGE, the White HouseclarifiedFeb. 17 that he has no official role with the department inrecent court filings.

We rate the claim that the NFL canceled DOGE ads False."
A new California law set to take effect in 2027 will require kids ages 8- to 16-years-old to sit in a booster seat while riding in a vehicle.,False,"It’s misleading to assert that the law “requires” a booster seat for the specified age group. The law only requires children to sit in a booster seat if they do not meet the requirements of a new five-step test, or conditions for being seated comfortably and safely when constrained by a seat belt. Such a test is more a question of body size rather than age and will not apply to all children.
Claims that a new California law will require children 8- to 16-years-old to use a booster seat while riding in a vehicle circulated online in mid-to-late November 2025.
Users on social media platforms likeX(archived) andparticularlyFacebook(archived,archived) shared their frustrations with the alleged change, with one parent onTikTok(archived) sharing a video of their unamused teenage daughter attempting to sit in such a booster seat.
The assertion that the new law will ""require"" teens in California to sit in a booster seat was overstated, and as such, we have rated this claim as false.
It is accurate to say that a new law could result insomekids ages 8 to 16 having to sit in a booster seat.
Specifically, the updated law, which wasapprovedby California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Oct. 7, 2025 and will go into effect Jan. 1, 2027, outlined a new ""5-step test"" that established requirements to be met for an individual to be considered ""properly restrained by a safety belt"" in the eyes of California state law.
The new requirements offered more specificity as to what is legally considered ""properly restrained."" Those requirements were outlined inthe billas follows:
(1) The child or ward is sitting all the way back against the auto seat.
(2) The knees of the child or ward bend over the edge of the auto seat.
(3) The shoulder belt snugly crosses the center of the child's chest and shoulder, not the child's neck.
(4) The lap belt is as low as possible and is touching the child or ward's thighs.
(5) The child or ward can stay seated like this for the whole trip.
By comparison, the bill stated that ""existing law defines, for purposes of the above provisions, 'properly restrained by a safety belt' to mean that the lap belt crosses the hips or upper thighs of the occupant and the shoulder belt, if present, crosses the chest in front of the occupant.""
The bill stated that the old requirements would ""remain in effect only until January 1, 2027,"" and the new requirements would ""become operative"" on the same day.
The bill wassupportedby the Automobile Club of California, AAA Northern California, Nevada & Utah, the National Highway Safety Administration and the California Department of Public Health, among other public safety organizations.
Current California law, as of this writing, stated ""a child or ward under 8 years of age who is 4 feet 9 inches in height or taller to be properly restrained by a safety belt rather than by a child passenger restraint system.""
Under the new updated law, height would still be a consideration as it would be a key determining factor in one passing the ""5-step test,"" but also takes into consideration other safety concerns for children.
A document capturing theAssembly Floor Analysisof the bill stated, ""recent data suggests that the minimum height requirements do not adequately capture the safety needs of children in vehicles.""
According to theCalifornia Highway Patrol(CHP), as of this writing, children are ""ready for a booster seat when they have outgrown the weight or height limit of their forward-facing harnesses, which is typically between 40 and 65 pounds,"" and should use them ""until they are at least 4'9"" and between 8 and 12 years old.""
CHP further pointed out that ""safety belts are designed for 165-pound male adults, so it's no wonder that research shows poorly fitting adult belts can injure children.""
Minnesotapassed a similar law in 2024 andLouisianain 2019.
In sum, users speculating about their older teens being ""required"" to use a booster seat until they are 16 likely have little to be concerned about if their child falls within theaverage growth rates.
So while California did vote to update its laws surrounding seat belt requirements for children, it is false to say that the new law ""requires"" booster seats for kids aged 8 to 16."
"In October 2025, a study showed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines helped extend cancer survival.",True,"COVID-19 mRNA vaccines create enough of an immunity boost to extend survival in certain types of lung and skin cancers, an analysis of more than 1,000 patient files showed. The scientific journal Nature published a research team's article about the study on Oct. 22, 2025. The lead scientist told The Washington Post the data needed ""to be confirmed in a Phase III trial.""
In October 2025, a rumor spread online that a new study had shown that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines helped prolong cancer survival(mRNA vaccinesuse laboratory-created messenger RNA — a genetic material that teaches cells how to make a proteins — to trigger an immune response in the body).
For example, on Oct. 20, one X usersaid(archived): ""A new study found that a simple mRNA vaccine - originally made for COVID - nearly doubled survival in patients with advanced lung and skin cancer.""
In a thread outlining the claim, the X useradded(archived) that the mRNA vaccines ""wake [the immune system] up,"" which ""boosts the body's ability to attack tumors.""
In short, the rumor was true. On Oct. 22, 2025, the scientific journal Nature published anarticle(archived) on the study. Itfocusedon patients with ""non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma [a type of skin cancer]"" who received immunotherapy andshowedthat mRNA COVID-19 jabs acted like an immunity boost.
A team of researchers from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and the University of Floridasaidsome cancer patients who receive immunotherapy, known as ""immune checkpoint inhibitors"" (ICIs), haveno ""pre-existing immunity,""which makes the ICIs ineffective in treating them.
After analyzing the files ofmore than 1,000 such patients, the findingsrevealedthat the efficacy of ICIs increased when the patients received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which activated the immune systems in a way thatsensitizedtumors to immunotherapy.
As a result, the scientists wrote, survival forNSCLCwent froma median of 20.6 months for unvaccinated patients to 37.3 months for those who received the jab (nearly double, as the X user claimed). Survival formelanomawent from 26.67 months for unvaccinated patients toa time so long the researcherscould not calculatea median.
""Although we focus on a single therapeutic due to its wide availability, these data could pave the way for other universal mRNA therapeutics specifically designed to reset patient immune systems for enhanced response to immunotherapy,"" the researcherswrote.
The medical community haslongbeensearching for mRNA vaccinesto help treat cancer.Personalized mRNA vaccines havealready proved effective, but they arecostlyand labor-intensive. By showing the efficacy of a ""one-size-fits-all"" mRNA vaccine developed for a different purpose — the COVID-19 virus — on cancer treatment, the study created hope for a universal mRNA vaccine to help boost the efficacy of immunotherapy. Such a universal vaccine would make treatment considerably speedier and more accessible.
The lead scientist, Adam Grippin of MD Anderson, toldThe Washington Postthe findings needed more research. ""This data is incredibly exciting, but it needs to be confirmed in a Phase III clinical trial,"" Grippin said. (Phase III trialsrecruit large numbers of patients to verify a drug's safety and efficacy.)
Snopes contacted Grippin asking for more details about what the next steps would entail. We await a response."
Harvard University “refuse(s) to tell us” who its international students are.,False,"President Donald Trump said Harvard University refuses to tell the U.S. government who its international students are.

On May 22, the Trump administration stripped Harvard of the federal government certification that lets it enroll international students. A federal judge on May 23temporarily blockedthe administration’s effort.

""Part of the problem with Harvard is that there are about 31% of foreigners coming to Harvard ... but they refuse to tell us who the people are,"" Trump toldreportersMay 25. ""We want a list of those foreign students and we'll find out whether or not they're OK. Many will be OK, I assume. And I assume with Harvard many will be bad.""

The Department of Homeland Security says Harvard did not provide the information it requested about the university’s international students. DHS cited that as one reason for revoking Harvard’s certification. But Harvard disputed that in its lawsuit against the Trump administration.

Courts have not yet ruled on whether Harvard complied with providing DHS with the additional information it requested. DHS asked for details about students’ activities, including ""illegal"" and ""dangerous or violent activity."" However, immigration law experts said Trump’s statement that the U.S. government doesn’t know the identities of Harvard’s international students is incorrect.

U.S. colleges and universities that enroll international students must be certified under the Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, called SEVP.

SEVP’s database ""contains all information about every student visa holder. Addresses, courses, grades, jobs, social media accounts, and much more,"" Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration lawyer and Emory University law professor, said.

Harvard has been certified to enroll international students since 1954, according to court documents. As part of the certification the university is required to report to the U.S. government detailed information about its international students.

Schools renew their SEVP certification every two years. In its lawsuit, Harvard said the university’s ""seamless recertification across this period — spanning more than 14 presidential administrations,"" is evidence of its compliance.

Additionally, to enter the U.S., all international students must apply for and be issued student visas via the State Department. To be eligible for a student visa, a person must be enrolled in an SEVP-certified university. The visa application process requires students to provide the U.S. government with detailed biographical information.

When contacted for comment, a White House spokesperson said Trump was ""making a simple ask"" for Harvard to comply with the government.

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program ""collects, maintains, analyzes and provides information so only legitimate foreign students or exchange visitors gain entry to the United States,"" the DHSwebsitesays. ""SEVP also ensures that the institutions accepting nonimmigrant students are certified and follow the federal rules and regulations that govern them.""

As part of the program, DHS manages theStudent and Exchange Visitor Information Systemwhich maintains records on international students and certified universities. Immigrationlawdictates what records universities must keep and report to maintain certification.

These records include ""U.S. entry and exit data, U.S. residential address changes, program extensions, employment notifications, and program of study changes,"" Sheila Vélez Martínez, University of Pittsburgh immigration law professor, said. ""The information is available to U.S. government agencies.""

The certification program does not provide visas to students. The federal State Departmentissuesvisas. To apply for a student visa, a person must fill out aformand schedule an interview. As part of the application process, students must provide biographical and employment information, including information about their relatives, and answer security questions, including about their criminal records.

On April 16, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent Harvard aletterrequesting information about every international student enrolled in the university. Noem asked for ""relevant information"" about international students’ ""illegal activity,"" ""dangerous or violent activity,"" ""known threats to students or university personnel"" and ""known deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel.""

Noem said failure to comply with the request would ""be treated as a voluntary withdrawal"" from the SEVP certification program.

On April 30, Steve Bunnell, a Harvard lawyer,respondedto Homeland Security with information about 5,200 international students, according to Bunnell’s email included in the court filing.

The university said it did not seek to withdraw from the certification and said although parts of Noem’s request used terms not defined in the immigration law that dictates what information universities must provide, ""Harvard is committed to good faith compliance and is therefore producing responsive materials that we believe are reasonably required"" by law.

According to Harvard’s lawsuit, theinformationincluded student identification numbers, names, dates of birth, countries of citizenship and enrollment information such as academic status, coursework and credit hours. Harvard also provided information about international students who left and why they left, which can cover a ""range of reasons, including but not limited to disciplinary action,"" Harvard’s email to DHS said.

On May 7, DHSrespondedsaying the information Harvard provided ""does not completely address the Secretary’s request."" It reiterated its original request.

HarvardrespondedMay 14 saying it was ""not aware of any criminal convictions"" of international students and identified three students who received disciplinary consequences.

As for students who deprived the rights of classmates, faculty or staff, Harvard said it did not find any.

On May 22, Noem sent Harvard alettersaying the university’s certification had been revoked.

""As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information … you have lost this privilege.""

Trump said Harvard University ""refuse(s) to tell us"" who its international students are.

To enroll international students, Harvard, and all other certified institutions must provide the U.S. government with detailed biographical information about every international student at its institution. That includes students’ names, addresses, contact information and details about their coursework.

Additionally, all international students must have student visas to enter the U.S. To get these, students who have enrolled in a government-certified university must apply via the State Department. That process also requires students to provide biographical and security information to the federal government.

"Regarding boat strikes off the coast of Venezuela, “Every boat that we knock out we save 25,000 American lives.”",False,"President Donald Trump said U.S. military strikes on five Venezuelan boats have saved more than 100,000 lives because the maneuvers thwarted drug smuggling.

""Every boat that we knock out we save 25,000 American lives so every time you see a boat and you feel badly you say, ‘Wow, that's rough;’ It is rough, but if you lose three people and save 25,000 people,"" President Donald Trump said in an Oct. 15press conference.

The administration did not supply PolitiFact with evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. Drug experts toldPolitiFactthat Venezuela plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. The legality of the strikes also is unclear. After the first attack, some legal experts toldPolitiFactthat the military action was illegal under maritime law or human rights conventions and the attack contradicted longstanding U.S. military practices.

Trump has used the figure repeatedly and also says he would consider similar strikes on land.

""Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people, and the destruction of families,"" Trump said in an Oct. 5speechto U.S. Navy sailors. ""So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness.""

""We've taken a very hard stand on drugs …  the water drugs — the drugs that come in through water they’re not coming — there are no boats anymore, frankly there are no fishing boats, there's no boats out there period,"" TrumptoldCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Oct. 7. ""We've probably saved at least 100,000 lives, American lives, Canadian lives, by taking out those boats.""

Several aspects of Trump’s statement make it wrong.

There is no way of knowing how many lives are saved as a result of drug interception efforts, drug experts have told PolitiFact.

Additionally, if Trump’s statement were accurate, the strikes on five boats in less than two months would have saved nearly double the number of U.S. lives lost to drug overdoses in an entire year.

The Trump administration hasn’t specified what type of drug or what quantity was on the boats that were struck. So it’s impossible to calculate how many deadly doses could have been destroyed.

Trump said the boats were carrying fentanyl during the Oct. 15 press conference.

""And you can see it, the boats get hit, and you see that fentanyl all over the ocean,"" Trump said. ""It's like floating in bags. It's all over the place.""

He hassharedaerialvideosof some of the boat strikes on Truth Social, and no bags of drugs are visible in the videos.

Additionally, most illicit fentanyl in the U.S.comes from Mexico, not Venezuela. It enters the U.S. mainly through the southern border at official ports of entry, and it’ssmuggledin mostly by U.S. citizens, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

If the boats each carried 25,000 lethal doses, that doesn’t mean the strikes stopped 125,000 people from dying of a drug overdose.

""When drugs are seized, the supply chain partially replaces those lost drugs,"" Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher, previously toldPolitiFact.

Overdose drug deaths have been declining for the past couple of years, before there were any strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC reported more than 73,000drug overdosedeaths from May 2024 to April 2025. For Trump’s statement to be accurate, the drugs on five boats would have been responsible for 125,000 deaths, nearly double the number of overdose deaths in one year.

Trump isn’t the first person to equate drug enforcement with saving lives. Over the years, we’vefact-checkedotherpoliticianswhen they said that a quantity of drugs seized at the U.S. border was enough to kill a specific number of people, or that those seizures saved a specific number of lives.

Generally, the politicians we have fact-checked referred to fentanyl seizures. The synthetic opioid is theleading causeof U.S. overdose deaths. Politicians’ statements about lives saved rely on the lethal dose for fentanyl — 2 milligrams. So if authorities seized 10 milligrams of fentanyl, for example, that saved five lives, politicians say.

But there are caveats to that calculation because a dose’s lethality can vary based on a person's height, weight and tolerance from past exposure, drug experts say. And statistics about how many drugs were stopped from entering the U.S. don’t account for how many drugs make it into the country.

""We don’t have any method I’m aware of for translating drug seizure data into any measure of overdose deaths averted,"" Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, a Johns Hopkins University health policy expert, toldPolitiFactin May.

Regarding boat strikes off the coast of Venezuela, Trump said, ""Every boat that we knock out we save 25,000 American lives.""

Trump said the five boats the U.S. military has struck off the coast of Venezuela were carrying drugs heading to the U.S. However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S.

The administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.

Even if the boats were carrying 25,000 lethal drug doses each, that doesn’t mean that destroying them saved 125,000 lives. There were 73,000 U.S. drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. That means the drugs on five boats would have been responsible for 125,000 deaths, nearly double the number of U.S. overdose deaths in one year.

The amount of drugs that are stopped from entering the U.S. doesn’t indicate how many lives were saved.
