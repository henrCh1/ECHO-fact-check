  "claim": "America officially declares war against Iram",
  "verdict": "False",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "The claim that 'America officially declares war against Iram' is false. Assuming 'Iram' is a misspelling of 'Iran', there is no record of the United States having officially declared war on Iran. Under the U.S. Constitution, the power to declare war rests solely with the U.S. Congress. The last time the U.S. Congress formally declared war was during World War II against several Axis powers. While the United States has engaged in military actions and maintained significant tensions with Iran, including sanctions and occasional skirmishes, these actions have not constituted an official declaration of war. Furthermore, a search for an entity named 'Iram' against which the U.S. has declared war yields no results, reinforcing the conclusion that the claim is baseless.",
