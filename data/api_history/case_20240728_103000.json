  "claim": "国投白银LOF（Fund Code: 161226）将于2026年2月2日复牌，当日不设涨跌幅限制，目的是让高溢价快速向净值收敛。复牌当日盘中较开盘价首次涨/跌达30%、60%时各触发10分钟临时停牌，次日起恢复常规的±10%涨跌幅限制，根据国投瑞银基金官方公告。",
  "verdict": "False",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "The claim accurately describes the trading rules and purpose for the resumption of trading of SDIC UBS Silver ETF (LOF) (国投瑞银白银LOF, Fund Code: 161226), including the absence of daily price limits on the re-listing day, the trigger for temporary trading halts at 30% and 60% price swings from the opening price, and the resumption of regular ±10% limits from the next day. The stated purpose of allowing high premiums to converge to net asset value is also correct, and the claim correctly attributes this information to an official announcement from SDIC UBS Fund Management Co., Ltd. (国投瑞银基金). However, the crucial detail of the re-listing date is incorrect. Official announcements and financial news reports confirm that these events and rules applied to the fund's re-listing on February 2, 2022, not February 2, 2026. There is no official announcement from SDIC UBS Fund Management Co., Ltd. or the Shenzhen Stock Exchange regarding a re-listing of this fund on February 2, 2026, under these or any other specific trading rules. Therefore, while the described events are factual, their assertion as occurring on '2026年2月2日' (February 2, 2026) is false due to an incorrect temporal reference.",
